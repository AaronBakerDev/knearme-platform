LLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.
This is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is a field guide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.

This list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.

The patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor use of language and punctuation, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.

The speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. The other signs are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.

Do not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than might be achieved by chance, these tools have non-trivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[1] Detectors can be brittle to multiple factors such as text modifications (e.g. paraphrasing and spacing changes) and the use of generative models not seen during detector training.[2] By the same token, do not trust too much in your own interpretation. Research shows that people who use LLMs heavily themselves can correctly determine whether an article was generated by AI about 90% of the time, which means that if you are an expert user of LLMs and you tag 10 pages as being AI-generated, you've probably falsely accused one editor.[3] People who don't personally use LLMs much do only slightly better than random chance (in both directions) for identifying AI-generated articles.[3]

LLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a "tell" for detecting AI-generated content.

For example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the highly specific "inventor of the first train-coupling device" might become "a revolutionary titan of industry." It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[a]

This statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.

Undue emphasis on symbolism, legacy, and importance

LLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.[4] There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.[5]

The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. [...]

The founding of Idescat represented a significant shift toward regional statistical independence, enabling Catalonia to develop a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context.

LLMs may include these statements for even the most mundane of subjects like etymology or population data. Sometimes, they add hedging preambles acknowledging that the subject is relatively unimportant or low-profile, before talking about its importance anyway.

Examples

When talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss an animal or plant species), LLMs tend to over-emphasize connections to the broader ecosystem or environment, even when those connections are tenuous or generic. LLMs also tend to belabor the species' conservation status and research and preservation efforts, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.

Examples

Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage
Words to watch: independent coverage, local/regional/national/[country name] media outlets, music/business/tech outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence
Similarly, LLMs act as if the best way to prove that a subject is notable is to hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often by listing sources that a subject has been covered in. They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own superficial analyses to the source. This is more common in text from newer AI tools (2025 or later).

Human-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact wording of Wikipedia's guidelines, such as "independent coverage."

Examples

In some cases, LLMs will create entire sections to assert notability, with a breakdown of the sources that have covered the topic in a list format. This is in contrast to how most articles are written — summarizing the content that sources publish, then citing them as footnotes.

Words to watch: ensuring ..., highlighting ..., emphasizing ..., reflecting ..., underscoring ..., showcasing ..., ensuring ..., conducive/tantamount/contributing to ..., cultivating ..., encompassing ..., aligns with..., essentially/fundamentally is...
AI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact.[6] This is often done by attaching a present participle ("-ing") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below).[6][4]

While many of these words are strong AI tells on their own,[5][7] an even stronger tell is when the subjects of these verbs are facts, events, or other inanimate things. A person, for example, can highlight or emphasize something, but a fact or event cannot. The "highlighting" or "underscoring" is not something that is actually happening; it is a claim by a disembodied narrator about what something means.[4]

Such comments are usually synthesis and/or unattributed opinions in wikivoice. Newer chatbots with retrieval-augmented generation (for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) may attach these statements to named sources—e.g., "Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence"—regardless of whether those sources say anything close.

These projects align with KQ's goals of reducing its environmental footprint, improving operational efficiency, and fostering community development through job creation. CEO Allan Kilavuka emphasized the airline's commitment to sustainability, customer focus, and Africa's prosperity through responsible corporate practices. Kenya Airways’ Water Bottling Plant, with a daily capacity of 4,500 liters, will "reduce reliance on external suppliers and significantly lower water procurement costs while generating additional revenue through potential water sales." Similarly, the Pyro-Diesel Plant, producing 700–1,000 liters of diesel daily, "will make a tangible impact on our operational costs, reducing fuel expenses and decreasing the environmental footprint of our ground operations," said George Kamal. These initiatives demonstrate Kenya Airways' dual commitment to sustainability and financial prudence. As Kamal emphasized, "We are not just cutting costs for short-term gains; we are building a more resilient and sustainable future for Kenya Airways."

Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for "Future Prospects."

Many studies have demonstrated that LLMs overuse certain words – especially compared to pre-2022 text, which is almost certain to be human-written.[5] These "AI vocabulary" words are also ubiquitous in AI-generated encyclopedias, such as Grokipedia, and in AI-generated Wikipedia text. They often co-occur in LLM output: where there is one, there are likely others.[10] An edit introducing one or two of these words may not be a big deal, but an edit (post-2022) introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells for AI use.

The distribution of "AI vocabulary" is slightly different depending on which chatbot or LLM was used,[6] and has changed over time. For instance, the word delve was famously overused by ChatGPT until 2025, when its incidence dropped off sharply.[11]

Please keep context in mind. For example, while the word "underscore" is overused in AI text, it can also refer to a literal underline mark, or to incidental music.

Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativity freely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. [...]

In this new chapter of his life, Yankilevsky found himself amidst a community of like-minded artists who, despite diverse styles, shared a common goal—to break free from the confines of state-imposed artistic norms, particularly socialist realism. [...]

False ranges
Shortcut
WP:FALSERANGE
When from ... to ... constructions are not used figuratively, they are used to indicate the lower and upper bounds of a scale. The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. "from seed to tree", "from mild to severe", "from white belt to black belt"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts (clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.

LLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a false range. LLMs often employ "figurative" (often simply: meaningless) "from ... to ..." constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by examples of persuasive writing during their training.

Excessive use of boldface
For non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting § Boldface.
Shortcut
WP:AIBOLD
AI chatbots may display various phrases in boldface for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner. One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a "key takeaways" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.

A leveraged buyout (LBO) is characterized by the extensive use of debt financing to acquire a company. This financing structure enables private equity firms and financial sponsors to control businesses while investing a relatively small portion of their own equity. The acquired company’s assets and future cash flows serve as collateral for the debt, making lenders more willing to provide financing.

Inline-header vertical lists
Shortcut
WP:AILIST

AI chatbots output often includes vertical lists formatted in a specific way: an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header, separated with a colon from the remaining descriptive text.

Instead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), hash (#), emoji, or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext. When copied as bare text appearing on the screen, some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.

Overuse of em dashes
For non-AI-specific guidance about the use of dashes, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Dashes.
Shortcut
WP:AIDASH
While human editors and writers often like em dashes (—), AI loves them.[11][9] LLM output uses them more often than nonprofessional human-written text of the same genre, and uses them in places where humans are more likely to use commas, parentheses, colons, or (misused) hyphens (-). LLMs especially tend to use em dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking "punched up" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.

This sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.

Examples

The term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people of the autonomous countries themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally and erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.

Curly quotation marks and apostrophes
For non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Quotation characters, and Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Apostrophes.
Shortcut
WP:AICURLY
AI chatbots typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks ("..." or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’), the same character as the curly right single quotation mark, instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They may also do this inconsistently.

Curly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a "smart quotes" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as LanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like Citer may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,

McClelland, Mac (September 27, 2017). "When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence". The New York Times. Retrieved August 3, 2025.

Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers and speculation about gaps in sources

Words to watch: as of [date],[b] Up to my last training update, as of my last knowledge update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., not widely available/documented/disclosed, ...in the provided/available sources/search results..., based on available information ...
A knowledge-cutoff disclaimer is a statement used by the AI chatbot to indicate that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.

If an LLM has a fixed knowledge cutoff (usually the model's last training update), it is unable to provide any information on events or developments past that time, and it often outputs a disclaimer to remind the user of this cutoff, which usually takes the form of a statement that says the information provided is accurate only up to a certain date.

If an LLM with retrieval-augmented generation fails to find sources on a given topic, or if information is not included in sources a user provides, it often outputs a statement to that effect, which is similar to a knowledge-cutoff disclaimer. It may also pair it with text about what that information "likely" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely speculative (including the very claim that it's "not documented") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated.

Prompt refusal
Words to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I cannot offer medical advice, but I can..., I'm sorry ...
Occasionally, the AI chatbot declines to answer a prompt as written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is "an AI language model". Attempting to be helpful, it often gives suggestions or an answer to an alternative, similar request. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.

Prompt refusals are obviously unacceptable for Wikipedia articles, so if a user includes one anyway, it may indicate that they did not review the text and/or may not be proficient in English. Remember to assume good faith, because that editor may genuinely want to improve our coverage of knowledge gaps.

Markup
Use of Markdown
Shortcut
WP:MARKDOWN
A lot of AI chatbots are not particularly proficient in wikitext, the markup language used to instruct Wikipedia's MediaWiki software how to format an article. As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.

When asked about its "formatting guidelines", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions typically generates some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):

## Formatting Guidelines

- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  
- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).  
- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).  
- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  
- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  
- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  
- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  
- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.  
- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  
- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  
- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  
- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.
As the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.

Even when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to "generate an article", a chatbot typically defaults to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might "realize" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)?[c] in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ```wikitext.[d]

The presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.

I believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am "not here to build an encyclopedia". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments "AI-generated" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.

Non-existent or out-of-place categories and "see also" pages
Shortcut
WP:AIREDCAT
LLMs may hallucinate non-existent categories, sometimes for generic concepts that seem like plausible category titles (or SEO keywords), and sometimes because their training set includes obsolete and renamed categories. These will appear as red links. You may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite Category:Entrepreneurs. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.

Pay attention to blue links under see also headers as well. LLM-generated "see also" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least three links) seemingly out of obligation. If a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like Financial technology in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.

Of course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule. New users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections, and returning editors may be used to old categories that have since been deleted.

Examples

Non-existent templates
LLMs often hallucinate non-existent templates (especially plausible-sounding types of infoboxes) and template parameters. These will also appear as red links, and non-existent template parameters in existing templates have no effect. LLMs may also use templates that were deleted after their knowledge cutoff date.

Examples

{{Infobox ancient population

Broken external links
If a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., returning 404 errors), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like Internet Archive or Archive Today. Most links become broken over time, but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.

Invalid DOI and ISBNs
For non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.
A checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.

Related are DOIs that point to entirely unrelated articles and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are "ohmic," meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].

The book references appear valid – a book on electric circuits would likely have information about Ohm's law – but without the page number, that citation is not useful for verifying the claims in the prose. Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3.

Incorrect or unconventional use of references
Shortcut
WP:AICITESTYLE
AI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.

Examples

From this revision to a user sandbox
In the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.

In this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the "third source" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.

The LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.

Note: While this does definitively prove ChatGPT's involvement, it doesn't prove, on its own, that ChatGPT also generated the writing. Some editors use AI tools to find citations for existing text; this will be apparent in the edit history.

Miscellaneous
Abrupt cut offs
AI tools may abruptly stop generating content, for example if they predict the end of text sequence (appearing as <|endoftext|>) next. Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses require the user to select "continue generating".

This method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.

Sudden shift in writing style
A sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.

Combining formal and casual writing styles is not exclusive to AI, but may be considered a sign.

Using more formal prose in some writing may simply be a matter of code switching.

Sudden shift in English variety use
A mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used may indicate the use of AI tools. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[8] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.

Overwhelmingly verbose edit summaries
AI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.

Refined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance. Added proper formatting and categorized the entry accordingly

"Submission statements" in AFC drafts
This one is specific to drafts submitted by Articles for Creation. At least one LLM tends to insert "submission statements" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, all this actually does is let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.

Reviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book "1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus). There is also a Portuguese version of this article at pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Patrão. Thank you for your review. -->

Pre-placed maintenance templates
Occasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an AFC review template already set to "declined". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like {{AfC submission|d}}, in which the "d" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{AfC submission/declined}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free "submission declined" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.

LLMs have been known to create pages that already have maintenance templates that shouldn't plausibly be there, including maintence tags and incorrect protection templates.

Signs of human writing
Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch
ChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.

It is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI-generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.

Ability to explain one's own editorial choices
Editors should be able to explain why they made one or more edits or mistakes. For example, if an editor inserts a URL that appears fabricated, you can ask how the mix-up occurred instead of jumping to conclusions. If they can supply the correct link and explain it as a human error (perhaps a typo), or share the relevant passage from the real source, that points to an ordinary human error.

Ineffective indicators
False accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.

Perfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also § Sudden shift in English variety use.) Some may alternatively interpret AI as using "bad grammar", yet the prose may merely adhere to different prescriptions or stylistic principles, such as whether singular indefinite "they" is acceptable.
Combination of casual and formal registers, or language that sounds both "clinical" and "emotional": This may indicate the casual writing of a person in a technical field, such as computer science. It may also indicate youth, a preference for mixed registers, playfulness, or neurodivergence. Or it may simply be the result of multiple editors adding to a page.
"Bland" or "robotic" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as "robotic" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[14]
"Fancy," "academic," or unusual words: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult readability scores, the correlation does not extend to all "fancy," academic, or "advanced"-sounding prose.[1] Low-frequency and "unusual" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.
Shortcut
WP:AILETTER
Letter-like writing (in isolation): Although many talk page messages written with salutations, valedictions, subject lines, and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, letters and emails have conventionally been written in such ways long before modern LLMs existed. Human editors (particularly newer editors) may format their talk page comments similarly for various reasons, such as being more accustomed to formal communication, posting as part of a school assignment that requires such at one, or simply mistaking the talk page for email. AI-generated talk page messages tend to have other tells, such as vertical lists[f], placeholders, or abrupt cutoffs.
Conjunctions (in isolation): While LLMs tend to overuse connecting words and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate synthesis of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves. While many people are taught beginning a sentence with a coordinating conjunction is nonstandard (or at least bad style), such usage has precedence and is accepted by many style guides.
Bizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in § Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, "inexplicable" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in § Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as "Catch-22 is a satirical novel.") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.
