# UX/UI Findings — Contractor Dashboard (Manual QA)

Date: 2025-12-26
Environment: Local (`http://localhost:3000`) — user `hi+fmb@aaronbaker.co`
Scope: Dashboard + Projects list + New Project flow + Edit Project + Profile Edit + Settings

---

## Summary (High Impact)
- New Project flow has a **hidden send action** (enter key works, but no visible send button state), which is confusing for first-time users.
- Projects list cards **don’t look clickable** and the action menu uses a **tiny unlabeled icon**, making project navigation feel ambiguous.
- Profile services toggles rely on color only (no aria-pressed/selected state), so **selected vs unselected is not obvious**, especially for accessibility.

## UX / UI Issues

### 1) New Project: Send control looks disabled/hidden (Desktop)
- **Category:** Usability / Performance perception
- **Where:** `/projects/new` (Step 1 chat input)
- **Current experience:** After typing, the send button becomes enabled but appears visually identical to the mic/record button. There’s no clear affordance that the message can be sent (unless user presses Enter). It’s easy to miss the submit action.
- **Impact:** High — blocks/slowdowns at the start of the funnel.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-new-send-state.png`, `tmp/ux-new-send-click.png`
- **Suggestion:** Make the send affordance obvious when text is present (change icon/state, show “Send”, or use a distinct button color). Consider enabling a visible inline “Send” label on focus.

### 2) New Project: Attach flow is multi-step and modal hides main context
- **Category:** Usability / Information Architecture
- **Where:** `/projects/new` → Attach photos
- **Current experience:** User must click attach icon → modal → click “Add” to open file picker. The modal hides the chat prompt and preview, so it’s unclear what the next step is after upload. The "Done" button occupies the entire bottom bar, which can read like a disabled primary CTA.
- **Impact:** Medium — extra clicks + momentary confusion.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-projects-new-attach.png`, `tmp/ux-projects-new-attach-after.png`
- **Suggestion:** Allow direct file picker from the attach button, or auto-open file picker when modal opens. Keep a small visible preview/context or an inline step hint.

### 3) New Project: Right-hand preview feels empty/inactive
- **Category:** Visual hierarchy / Performance perception
- **Where:** `/projects/new` (preview pane)
- **Current experience:** The preview pane remains faint and mostly blank during early steps, which makes the overall page feel inactive. Users may not realize it’s a live preview.
- **Impact:** Medium — reduces confidence in progress.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-projects-new-step1.png`, `tmp/ux-projects-new-after-assistant.png`
- **Suggestion:** Add a light skeleton or “Live preview updates here” callout until first content renders.

### 4) Projects List: Cards don’t appear clickable
- **Category:** Usability
- **Where:** `/projects`
- **Current experience:** Cards are flat with no hover or cursor change, and clicking the title doesn’t navigate. The only visible action is a small 3-dot menu on the right (no label/tooltip in UI).
- **Impact:** High — users may not discover how to open a project.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-projects-list-top.png`, `tmp/ux-projects-click-card.png`
- **Suggestion:** Make the entire card a link with hover state + pointer cursor. Add a visible “Edit” or “Open” affordance.

### 5) Projects List: Action menu is small + ambiguous
- **Category:** Usability / Accessibility
- **Where:** `/projects` cards
- **Current experience:** The kebab menu icon is very small and has no visible label; it’s hard to scan in a dense grid.
- **Impact:** Medium — discoverability issue.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-projects-list-top.png`
- **Suggestion:** Use a labeled button (“Actions”), enlarge hit area, or show secondary actions on hover.

### 6) Projects List: Extremely long list without pagination or clear end state
- **Category:** Usability / Information architecture
- **Where:** `/projects` (All tab)
- **Current experience:** The list is extremely long, with many “Untitled Project” cards and no visible pagination or “end of list” indicator. Scrolling is overwhelming.
- **Impact:** Medium — scanning and navigation cost increases for active users.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-projects-list-bottom.png`
- **Suggestion:** Add pagination, infinite scroll sentinel, or grouping + collapse.

### 7) Profile Edit: Selected services rely on color only
- **Category:** Accessibility / Visual design
- **Where:** `/profile/edit`
- **Current experience:** Selected vs unselected service chips are indicated primarily by color; there’s no explicit selected state icon or `aria-pressed` for screen readers.
- **Impact:** Medium — color-blind and keyboard users will struggle.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-profile-edit-loaded.png`
- **Suggestion:** Add visible selected indicators (checkmark), and `aria-pressed` on toggle buttons.

### 8) Project Edit: Publish checklist duplicates on each tab and dominates scroll
- **Category:** Information architecture
- **Where:** `/projects/[id]/edit` (Content/Images/SEO tabs)
- **Current experience:** The publish checklist appears on every tab and is long, pushing the main form lower and increasing scroll. It visually competes with the primary editing form.
- **Impact:** Medium — reduces focus on current task.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-project-edit-content.png`, `tmp/ux-project-edit-images.png`, `tmp/ux-project-edit-seo.png`
- **Suggestion:** Make checklist collapsible or sticky in a side panel, or show a compact summary in non-content tabs.

### 9) Project Edit: AI Assistant drawer starts in loading state without context
- **Category:** Performance perception / Usability
- **Where:** `/projects/[id]/edit` → AI Assistant panel
- **Current experience:** Opening AI Assistant shows “Loading project…” for several seconds without progress or context. Users may think it’s stuck.
- **Impact:** Low/Medium — trust + perceived performance.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-project-edit-ai.png`, `tmp/ux-project-edit-ai-loaded.png`
- **Suggestion:** Add subtext (“Fetching project data…”) + progress indicator or skeleton content.

### 10) Settings: Push notifications CTA appears disabled/indeterminate
- **Category:** Usability / Performance perception
- **Where:** `/settings` (Notifications card)
- **Current experience:** The button shows “Checking” with a spinner and the primary CTA “Enable notifications” is below, but it’s unclear which action is possible right now. The “Checking” pill reads like a disabled state.
- **Impact:** Low/Medium — ambiguous action.
- **Evidence:** `tmp/ux-settings.png`, `tmp/ux-settings-mobile.png`
- **Suggestion:** Replace “Checking” pill with inline status text or disable the CTA with a clear “Checking permissions…” message.
