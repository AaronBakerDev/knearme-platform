faqs:
  - question: "Are repointing and tuckpointing the same thing?"
    answer: "Repointing replaces deteriorated mortar joints. Tuckpointing is a style of repointing that adds a thin contrasting line for a crisp look. In everyday use, contractors often use the terms interchangeably."
  - question: "Does tuckpointing cost more than repointing?"
    answer: "If tuckpointing includes the decorative contrasting line, it can cost slightly more due to extra tooling. Most residential work is priced like standard repointing."

Homeowners hear both terms, often on the same estimate. Here’s the simplest way to think about it:

- **Repointing** is the repair.
- **Tuckpointing** is a repointing technique that can also change the wall’s appearance.

## Repointing (the repair)

Repointing means:

1. Removing failing mortar to a consistent depth.
2. Packing new mortar into the joints.
3. Tooling the joint to match the original profile.

This restores water resistance and structural bond.

## Tuckpointing (the technique)

Traditional tuckpointing adds a second thin line of contrasting mortar to make joints appear finer and more uniform. Many modern contractors still call standard repointing “tuckpointing,” especially on residential brick.

## When the difference matters

- If your home has **historic brick and decorative joints**, true tuckpointing may be appropriate.
- If you just need failing joints replaced, standard repointing is what you’re paying for.

## Cost impact

For planning purposes, both fall in the same range for most homes:

- **$6–$25 per sq ft** of wall area installed.

Use your wall size to get a realistic estimate:

1. Measure wall area: [How to Measure Wall Area for Tuckpointing](/learn/how-to-measure-wall-area-for-tuckpointing).
2. Estimate mortar + time: [Tuckpointing Material + Labor Calculator](/tools/tuckpointing-calculator).
3. Budget the full job: [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator).
