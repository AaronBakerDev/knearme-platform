Most tuckpointing bids are based on **square feet of wall area**, so a simple measurement can save you money and help you compare quotes correctly.

> After measuring, run a planning estimate in the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator) with **Tuckpointing** selected.

## Step 1: Measure Wall Length

Measure along the base of the wall.

If you can’t access a tape measure for the whole length, you can estimate:

- Count bricks across one row (standard brick ≈ 8")
- Multiply count × 8" and convert to feet

## Step 2: Measure Wall Height

Measure from the ground to the top of the wall.

For tall facades, estimate by stories:

- 1 story ≈ 9–10 ft
- 2 stories ≈ 18–20 ft

## Step 3: Calculate Wall Area

`Wall area (sq ft) = length (ft) × height (ft)`

Example:

- 30 ft long × 8 ft high = **240 sq ft**

## Step 4: Estimate the Damaged Zone

Walk the wall and note where mortar is missing, soft, or deeply recessed.

- If damage is isolated (10–30 sq ft), a spot repair might be enough.
- If damage is widespread, plan on full repointing.

## Next Steps

- Use your wall area in the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator).
- Get bids that state square footage so you can compare fairly.
