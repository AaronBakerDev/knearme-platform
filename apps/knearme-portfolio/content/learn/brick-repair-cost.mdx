Brick repair costs depend on whether you’re fixing mortar joints (repointing) or replacing damaged bricks. This guide gives realistic planning ranges and shows how to scope your job.

> **Start here:** Estimate brick count and budget with the [Brick Replacement Calculator](/tools/brick-replacement-calculator).

## Typical Brick Repair Costs

| Repair type | Typical cost range |
|---|---|
| Spot brick replacement | $15 – $60 per sq ft damaged area |
| Tuckpointing / repointing | $6 – $25 per sq ft wall area |
| Partial wall rebuild | $1,500 – $8,000+ |

## What Drives Cost

- Brick matching difficulty.
- Extent of damage.
- Wall height / access.
- Whether mortar joints also need repointing.

## How to Estimate Your Brick Count

1. Measure damaged area (sq ft).
2. Plug into the [Brick Replacement Calculator](/tools/brick-replacement-calculator).

Then, budget the full job using the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator).
