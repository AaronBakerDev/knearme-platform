If you see staining on ceilings near a chimney or leaks after rain, flashing failure is one of the most common causes. Flashing is the metal seal where the chimney meets the roof.

> **Budget fast:** Use the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator) with **Chimney Repair** selected.

## Signs Your Flashing Has Failed

- Water stains in attic or ceiling near chimney.
- Rusted or lifted metal at roofline.
- Crumbling mortar around counterflashing.

## Typical Repair Options

1. **Reseal minor gaps** (cheapest).
2. **Replace step flashing**.
3. **Re-seat or rebuild counterflashing**.

## Cost Range

Most homeowners see **$350–$900**. Steep roofs, tall chimneys, or full counterflashing replacement push costs higher.
