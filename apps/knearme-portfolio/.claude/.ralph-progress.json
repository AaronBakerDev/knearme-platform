  "notes": "ALL CHECKPOINTS COMPLETE! Manual QA verified: Profile Reveal shows after confirmation with bio, 3 review highlights, project suggestions. No duplicate search results. The duplicate search bug was fixed by dynamically removing showBusinessSearchResults tool when businessName exists in state. POST-ONBOARDING FIX: Contractor sync was failing because it tried to write address/postal_code/phone/website columns that don't exist in contractors table. Fixed by only syncing existing columns. Synced existing user's data from businesses to contractors."
