### How KnearMe Helps Mike
| Pain Point | KnearMe Solution |
|------------|------------------|
| No time to write | Agents generate professional descriptions |

### Success Scenario
Mike finishes a custom install on Thursday afternoon. While cleaning up, he snaps 5 photos with his phone. Driving home, he opens KnearMe and uploads the photos. The app asks him 4 questions—he answers by voice. By the time he gets home, there's a draft to approve. He taps "Looks good" and the project is live on his portfolio.

**Total time invested: 3 minutes**  
**Result: A professional showcase page ranking for "custom installs Denver"**
