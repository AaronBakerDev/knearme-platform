Accurate measurements help you get better quotes, avoid overpaying, and use calculators correctly. You don’t need to climb the roof to get a useful estimate — a safe ground‑level approach is enough for planning.

> After measuring, plug your numbers into the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator) for a planning budget.

## What You Need

- A phone camera
- Tape measure (optional)
- Notepad
- A helper (nice to have)

## Step 1: Estimate Chimney Height (Vertical Feet)

Most chimney repairs scale with vertical feet. You can estimate height in a few ways:

### Option A: Count brick courses

Standard bricks plus mortar joints are roughly **2.5 inches tall per course**. If you can see the full height:

1. Count the number of horizontal rows.
2. Multiply by 2.5".
3. Divide by 12 to get feet.

Example:

- 48 courses × 2.5" = 120" → 10 ft

### Option B: Compare to known house features

If counting courses is hard, compare to:

- a standard story height (about 9–10 ft)
- nearby windows or roofline features you can approximate

Write down your best estimate (don’t worry about being perfect).

## Step 2: Identify Affected Sides

Walk around your home and check each chimney face:

- Front
- Back
- Left
- Right

Note how many sides show cracking, missing mortar, spalling, or staining. Even a simple “2 sides affected” helps contractors scope work.

## Step 3: Estimate Damaged Area (Square Feet)

For each affected side, estimate:

1. **Width of damage (ft)**
2. **Height of damage (ft)**

Multiply to get square feet, then add sides together.

Example:

- Side A damage: 3 ft wide × 4 ft tall = 12 sq ft
- Side B damage: 2 ft wide × 5 ft tall = 10 sq ft
- Total damaged area ≈ 22 sq ft

## Step 4: Check the Crown and Flashing

From the ground, look for:

- Crown cracks, missing chunks, or pooling water stains.
- Flashing gaps where chimney meets the roof.

You don’t need measurements here; a simple yes/no note helps a contractor include this in the quote.

## Step 5: Record Key Symptoms

Use our symptom list to make sure you don’t miss anything:

- Cracked or missing mortar joints
- Spalling bricks
- White staining (efflorescence)
- Water leaks near chimney
- Leaning or tilting

## What to Do With Your Measurements

1. **Budget your project** with the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator).
2. **Share your notes and photos** when requesting bids.
3. **Compare quotes apples‑to‑apples** using the same size/area assumptions.
