faqs:
  - question: "How much does tuckpointing cost per square foot?"
    answer: "Most homeowners see tuckpointing cost roughly $6–$25 per square foot installed. Simple, low walls are on the low end; tall walls, historic brick, or scaffolding push costs higher."
  - question: "What’s the difference between tuckpointing and repointing?"
    answer: "Repointing replaces deteriorated mortar joints. Tuckpointing is a repointing method that also creates a thin contrasting line for a crisp appearance. Most contractors use the terms interchangeably." 
  - question: "Is tuckpointing worth it?"
    answer: "Yes. Replacing failing mortar prevents water entry and brick damage, often extending the life of a wall by decades. It’s usually far cheaper than brick replacement or rebuilds."

Tuckpointing is one of the most cost‑effective ways to extend the life of brick and stone walls, but pricing varies a lot by wall height, access, and how much mortar has failed. This guide gives realistic planning ranges and explains how to budget.

## Typical Tuckpointing Costs

Most tuckpointing quotes are based on the **square footage of wall face** (height × length).

| Wall type / access | Typical cost per sq ft |
|---|---|
| Single‑story wall, easy access | $6 – $12 |
| Two‑story wall | $10 – $20 |
| Tall walls requiring scaffolding | $15 – $25+ |
| Historic brick / special mortar match | Add 15–30% |

### What that means for total project cost

- Small patch (10–30 sq ft): **$300 – $900**
- Typical home wall section (50–150 sq ft): **$800 – $3,000**
- Whole‑home repointing or tall facades: **$3,000 – $10,000+**

## What Drives Tuckpointing Cost Up or Down

### 1. Percent of joints that are failing

If only a few joints are failing, a contractor can spot‑repoint. If most joints are soft, they need to remove and repoint much deeper.

### 2. Wall height and staging

Access is often the biggest cost driver. Scaffolding and safety setup take time and add labor.

### 3. Mortar depth and hardness

Old mortar can be very hard to remove cleanly without damaging brick faces.

### 4. Brick condition

If bricks are spalling or cracked, tuckpointing may also include brick replacement. See: [Tuckpointing vs Brick Replacement](/learn/tuckpointing-vs-brick-replacement).

### 5. Mortar color matching

Matching existing mortar color and profile takes extra time, especially on older homes.

## How to Estimate Your Wall Size

1. Measure wall length (ft).
2. Measure wall height (ft).
3. Multiply to get square feet.

Example:

- 25 ft long × 6 ft high = **150 sq ft wall area**

## Next Steps

- **Run a planning estimate** in the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator).
- **Compare quotes** using the same measured wall area.
- **Check other common symptoms** (cracks, efflorescence, leaks) to decide urgency.
