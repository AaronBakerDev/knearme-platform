faqs:
  - question: "How much does chimney repair cost per foot?"
    answer: "Most chimney repairs are priced by the type of damage, but a useful planning range is $150–$450 per vertical foot. Taller chimneys, steep roofs, or historic brick will push prices higher."
  - question: "What is the cheapest chimney repair?"
    answer: "Replacing a cap or resealing a small crown crack are usually the least expensive fixes, often a few hundred dollars. These repairs prevent water damage that can lead to much larger rebuilds."
  - question: "Why do chimney repair quotes vary so much?"
    answer: "Two chimneys can look similar but have very different issues. Access, height, hidden internal damage, brick matching, and local labor rates are the biggest drivers of price variation."
  - question: "Is chimney repair covered by homeowners insurance?"
    answer: "Insurance sometimes covers sudden events (like storm damage) but usually does not cover gradual wear or maintenance. Document the damage and check your policy before starting work."

Chimney repair costs can feel unpredictable because the job ranges from a simple mortar touch‑up to a full structural rebuild. This guide breaks down typical price ranges **by repair type**, explains what drives costs up and down, and shows how to budget realistically.

> **Want a fast budget range?** Use the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator) and select **Chimney Repair**. It gives a planning‑level low/typical/high range based on your chimney size and conditions.

## Quick Cost Reference

Below are common chimney repairs and the ranges homeowners typically see. These are installed prices including labor and materials.

| Repair type | Typical cost range | What it includes |
|---|---|---|
| Minor repointing / tuckpointing | $300 – $1,200 | Remove loose mortar, repoint joints, spot sealing |
| Crown repair or rebuild | $400 – $1,500 | Seal cracks or rebuild crown with proper slope/drip edge |
| Flashing repair | $350 – $900 | Replace step/counter flashing, reseal roof interface |
| Brick replacement (spalling) | $500 – $2,500 | Remove damaged bricks, match replacement, repoint |
| Partial rebuild (roofline up) | $1,500 – $6,000 | Demo and rebuild upper stack, new crown/flashing |
| Full rebuild | $4,000 – $15,000+ | Rebuild entire chimney, often with new liner/crown |

## How Chimney Repairs Are Priced

Contractors usually price chimneys using a mix of:

1. **Repair scope** (repoint vs rebuild)
2. **Chimney height and area** (vertical feet / number of sides)
3. **Access difficulty** (roof pitch, scaffolding, staging)
4. **Materials and matching** (historic brick, special mortar colors)

A practical planning number many homeowners use is **$150–$450 per vertical foot** of chimney repair area. That range overlaps most real‑world jobs, then shifts up or down depending on the factors below.

## The Biggest Cost Drivers

### 1. Extent of damage

- **Minor joint failure** = spot repointing.
- **Spalling and loose bricks** = brick replacement + deeper repointing.
- **Structural lean or major cracking** = partial or full rebuild.

### 2. Height and roof access

A 10‑foot chimney on a single‑story roof is cheaper to stage than a 25‑foot chimney on a steep two‑story roof. Expect higher bids when scaffolding or roof jacks are required.

### 3. Crown and flashing condition

Crowns and flashing are the most common leak points. If they’ve failed, repairs often include both masonry and roof‑interface work.

### 4. Brick and mortar matching

Historic homes and uncommon brick sizes/colors can increase labor and materials. Matching mortar color/profile is also time‑intensive.

### 5. Local labor market

Major metro areas and high‑cost regions typically run 15–25% above national averages.

## When Repair Becomes Rebuild

Use this rule of thumb:

- If **more than ~25–30% of the chimney stack is structurally compromised**, partial rebuilds are usually more cost‑effective than repeated spot repairs.
- Leaning chimneys or failed flue systems often require rebuild evaluation.

If you’re unsure, run the [Chimney Repair Urgency Checklist](/tools/chimney-repair-urgency-checklist) first.

## How to Get a Better Quote

1. **Measure your chimney** (height + approximate affected sides). See our guide: [How to Measure Your Chimney for Repair Estimates](/learn/how-to-measure-chimney-for-repair).
2. **Document symptoms** with photos.
3. **Ask what’s included** (crown? flashing? waterproofing? liner?).
4. **Get 2–3 bids** from pros who show real chimney work.
