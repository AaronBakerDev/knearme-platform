The chimney crown (the concrete cap around your flue) is the #1 place water enters a chimney. Fixing it early is one of the cheapest ways to avoid a major rebuild.

> **Planning tip:** Use the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator) with **Chimney Repair** selected to budget your full repair.

## Typical Crown Repair Costs

| Crown issue | Typical cost range |
|---|---|
| Small cracks sealed | $150 – $400 |
| Crown resurfacing / mortar wash | $250 – $700 |
| Full crown rebuild | $400 – $1,500 |

## When Sealing Is Enough

Sealing is usually fine when:

- Cracks are hairline to 1/8".
- Crown slope is intact.
- No loose chunks.

## When You Need a Rebuild

Rebuild is likely when:

- Large cracks or missing sections.
- Flat crown holding water.
- Brick spalling below crown line.

## What Drives Cost

- Chimney size (crown area).
- Roof access and pitch.
- Whether flashing or waterproofing is also needed.
