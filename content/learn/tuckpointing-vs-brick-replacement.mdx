  - question: "How do I know if tuckpointing is enough?"
    answer: "If the bricks are mostly sound but mortar joints are cracked, soft, or missing, tuckpointing is usually the right fix."
  - question: "When do bricks need to be replaced instead?"
    answer: "If bricks are spalling, cracked through, loose, or bulging, they often need replacement before repointing will hold."

Both tuckpointing and brick replacement fix masonry walls — but they solve different problems. Choosing the right repair keeps your wall strong and prevents you from paying for work you don’t need.

> **Budget tip:** If you’re deciding between repairs, run a planning estimate in the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator) to see how each option affects price.

## The Core Difference

- **Tuckpointing/repointing** replaces **failing mortar joints**.
- **Brick replacement** replaces **damaged bricks**.

In most real projects, brick replacement happens first in the affected spots, then tuckpointing restores all the joints.

## When Tuckpointing Is the Right Repair

Choose tuckpointing when:

- Mortar is cracked, powdery, or missing.
- Joints are recessed more than ~1/4".
- Bricks are intact and not flaking.
- Walls are plumb (not bulging).

**Why it works:** Mortar is sacrificial — it’s designed to fail before brick. Repointing restores water resistance and structural bond.

## When Brick Replacement Is Necessary

You likely need brick replacement when you see:

- **Spalling bricks** (faces popping off).
- Deep cracks through the brick body.
- Loose or shifting bricks.
- Bulging or bowing wall sections.

If bricks are failing, tuckpointing alone won’t last — the new mortar will just be bonded to weak brick.

## Cost Impact

- **Tuckpointing is cheaper** because it’s mostly labor on mortar.
- **Brick replacement costs more** due to:
  - matching materials
  - careful removal
  - rebuilding the wall face

Typical planning ranges:

- Tuckpointing: **$6–$25 per sq ft** of wall area.
- Brick replacement: **$15–$60 per sq ft** of damaged area.

## A Simple Decision Tree

1. **Are most bricks sound?**
   - Yes → tuckpointing is usually enough.
   - No → replace damaged bricks first.

2. **Is the wall bulging or leaning?**
   - Yes → structural evaluation; may require rebuild.
   - No → proceed with repair.

3. **Is water clearly getting in?**
   - Yes → prioritize repointing and waterproofing.

## Measure Your Wall First

Both repairs depend on size. Measure:

- Wall length
- Wall height
- Approximate damaged area

## Next Steps

- If joints are failing, estimate your wall size and run the [Masonry Repair Cost Estimator](/tools/masonry-cost-estimator).
- If bricks are failing, get bids that include both brick replacement and repointing.
