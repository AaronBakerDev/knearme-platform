We had a pergola installed on a 4-slab patio. After time, one slab popped up in the middle of our patio. I'm SO clumsy, I couldn't have that as a tripping hazard. I got a postcard from them so I called. We all assumed the pergola would be light enough to shoot foam and level it back out. The guys came - shout out to Luis and team - foam popped the corner twice as high. We decided to  grind it but it was just back to the original tripping hazard. I wasn't happy with it - I didn't see the first finished job because I had to leave and my husband said good to go! However, I wasn't ok with it being the same hazard. The owner agreed to have Luis come back and grind it more level. I'm happy with the results now. I appreciate the awesome team and the fact they made it right for us. Although it looks kinda ugly - not a big deal, I won't break myself from tripping now! I should also mention they grinded my front sidewalk crack, it turned out ok. Moral of the story is, if you're a picky-arse, messing with concrete is extremely tricky, and if you expect it to be fixed perfect, I suggest you rip it out and repour it. Thanks guys!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

A stand that is uneven and wobbles?  Or the fact that they installed the insert too low and when i close the doors the glass rattles because there is not enough air flow at the bottom of the insert.

I first emailed Matthew the owner late last year for building a keter artisan shed but was told there was no stock available anywhere. I reached out again the start of this season anticipating stock. Matthew was very professional and answered many of my questions and addressed all my concerns. I felt comfortable with moving forward and was scheduled in as one of first installs of the season.\n\nDue to weather, the date for concrete pour was moved a few days ahead, but I was notified the weekend before and we found a day that worked. On day for the concrete pour, Matthew came on time with 2 of his crew and spent most of the day on the concrete base. Work was completed on time and I paid for the base portion of the fees at that time. His crew came back a week later to install the shed and were done in the matter of a few hours. They did a good job cleaned up after themselves, including cleaning up most of the small bits of concrete that were scattered throughout the lawn from the install date. One thing to note though: they will not help dispose of the packaging for the shed, but they do help put everything into a giant plastic bag.\n\nOverall recommend the company as an e2e company for shed installs.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

The place was empty and the landlords had made a good effort to clean so it was already in decent shape - so we requested that the focus would be the floors, corners of baseboards, and inside of cabinets (things that are easy to miss for non professionals).\n\nThe cleaners arrived with two backpacks (the big ones that Uber deliveries also use). Right away, I was a bit worried because we didn’t see a vacuum, proper mop, etc., but the Google reviews were great so I just let it slide. We walked through and pointed out the areas we wanted to prioritize, and then we left.\n\nThe cleaners called about three hours later and asked us to come back to sign off. We were in a rush for other plans, so that wasn’t ideal. I know this sounds like standard practice in hindsight, but I wasn’t expecting it because I have hired other move-in cleaners before where I was able to just give my feedback later in the day by phone/email. The cleaners from Seeyon also didn’t mention that we’d need to come back to sign off on anything.\n\nAnyway, things here looked mostly okay when we came back - because we were in a rush and because the Google reviews were great, we just did a quick walk through to look for anything glaring and then signed off.\n\nThe apartment was vacant for 2 days after that and then we did our move. We were getting settled in and unpacking a few things and noticed that our feet were totally black after a few hours. Took a wet paper towel and wiped the floor, and it was also black. This was in a spot where we hadn’t been walking around or moving boxes, so the dirt couldn’t have been from us. We also didn’t have the air on while the place was empty, so we know it wasn’t the HVAC.\n\nAfter that, we decided to do a more thorough look and noticed a lot of areas were missed: corners of baseboards, a whole strip of the bathroom floor between the sink and bath tub, huge amount of food crumbs scattered in two of the cabinets that should have been vacuumed, dust on the cabinet floors.\n\nI contacted the company and they said they would send the cleaners back to remedy these issues, but the whole reason we booked the service in advance was so the place would be clean before we brought in all of our stuff. They also didn’t use the entire allotted time - we paid for 4-5 hours and they finished in 3 - they had time to address those things during the initial appointment. And honestly, without a proper mop and vacuum, I didn’t feel confident that the outcome would be much different.\n\nI appreciate that the cleaners worked hard and tried their best, and that the company was willing to resend them. However, I mostly just feel like I wasted my money on a clean that we could have done a better job doing ourselves. Fully aware this is a Ted Talk level review, but my decision to hire them was 100% because the prices are affordable and I read tons of positive Google reviews. Given my recent experience, I wanted to write an honest review so that someone else doesn’t make the same mistake that I do. If you aren’t able to do the clean yourself, or if your budget doesn’t allow you to hire a more expensive service, my advice is:\n\na) Either be present for the clean, or expect that they will call you to sign off at the end. They called us 1-2 hours before the end of the window we had paid for. Do a proper inspection after the clean (yes, I know, seems like something we should’ve known).\nb) If possible, supply your own mop, vacuum, and any other supplies that you think would be important for you to be satisfied with their service.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Ultimately we got a refund, so I'll give them that much as a positive, although they've taken hours of my time and left us shovelling snow, chasing them down, and scrambling to find reliable snow removal service.\n\nAddendum: I was contacted by the company being asked to change or take down my review since they gave me a refund and are a small business. I bumped them up to 2 stars, because it's true, they did ultimately give me the refund and they were acknowledging their fault and taking responsibility. But their response below (posted after the fact) is completely inconsistent. Their phone lines were not down because of high call volumes, it literally said \"this phone line is not in service\" for one number and was a woman's personal voicemail on the other number. They did not answer emails, submitted tickets, or phone calls and it took over 24 hours of incessantly trying to contact them to ultimately reach them via facebook and later got a response by text. Also, they did not offer the refund, it came after demands and threats of bad reviews. Initial excuses were one tractor is down, then 4 tractors were all down simultaneously, then not enough people in our area. The response below is shady and clearly does not take responsibility for a complete failure. Back down to 1 star.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Sergio was open and honest with his quote and educated me about the entire process.  This was extremely helpful because this was my first concrete project.  I had site visits with 4 other concrete estimators before calling Condor Concrete.  I was given their name by a neighbor who hired Condor Concrete to replace his driveway 10 years ago and it still looks like a new driveway.  I especially liked the fact that there was no peeling on his concrete.  Sergio explained that the peeling is caused when installation crews spray water on the drying concrete to buy more to finish it.  This results in weakened concrete bonding on the surface and leads to peeling usually within 3 years.\n\nThe installation crew, led by Ricardo, was fast, efficient and detail oriented.  They worked closely with me as I reworked my sprinkler system.  In fact, they were so careful installing the forms they found a shallow fiber optic line I had forgotten about and were careful not to cut it.  His team also expertly installed driveway edge curbs  due to raised landscaping.\n\nMy wife and I are extremely pleased with our new driveway and patio expansion and would give Sergio and his team 10 stars if we could.\nThanks a million Sergio!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Miguel was very timely in responding to my bid request as well as the scheduling of the project. There were two concrete pads that needed to be replaced and three more that were cracked. We requested bids to replace only two and bids to replace all five. We contacted Good Day to replace the two pads and were scheduled for the following Wednesday.  They were actually running ahead of schedule and replaced the pads on Monday. There was a miscommunication and all five pads were replaced. After I inspected the work and contacted Miguel, he immediately agreed to eat the additional cost and only charge for the work that was contracted. Mistakes happen and it is great to work with a company that is as responsive as Good Day Concrete. Thank you for being a pleasure to work with in what can be a very frustrating industry.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

I guess that was the best route of communication after having multiple texts ignored, and multiple visits where no one showed up.\n\nThey showed up the following day and finished the job. It wouldn't be right of my to not include the nice parts about my interaction. They did give me a few discounts, around 10% off my service due to a 3 month delay on parts and quite a few no show/rescheduled visits. I appreciated that. The doors are beautiful and my chimney works. Can't complain there.\n\nThe only part that really soured my experience was the lack of communication, having my texts ignored, and the significant delay in finishing what was started and paid for.  Pat did update me on why no one showed up to my house after the fact, each time it happened, which was quite a few. I never received  a call before hand though, no heads up. THAT is what I am upset about. Missing work and waiting for a crew that didn't show up, and didn't have the courtesy to call, multiple times.\n\nI would not recommend this company.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

We had our roof completed by Gerry's Roofing as part of an insurance claim and they were fantastic. Dave provided us multiple estimates so that we could reduce the back and forth between our insurance company - he literally saved me hours and I can't thank him enough. Not only did Dave save me hours, but he educated me about the different applications, slopes, and a bunch of other things so that I felt confident making a decision and taking the estimates to my insurance adjustor.\n\nThe project management was exceptional, they provided accurate timelines and kept us updated on scheduling the job. When Clay and his team showed up, they did an amazing job on the roof and kept the job site clean between working days. Not only did they do a great job of cleaning up, but they also cleaned out debris that landed in the neighbouring house's eaves. The crew was super friendly and respectful and I am very happy with the results.\n\n10/10 would recommend Clay's team and Gerry's Roofing as a whole. We will 100% hire them again when we are ready to complete more exterior work.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

The majority of the people I spoke with either didn't have the time for at least 2 months or weren't willing to come to the remote location.  Wendy, From JP Lucky, responded immediately and was able to perform the work within 1 week.  While the cost was slightly higher than some of the other contractors it was more important that we had the work done right and quickly.  The installers, James and his team, were very professional, hard-working, and quick to complete the job.  The job itself was very professional and we couldn't be happier.  I would highly recommend JP Lucky Construction for any fence installations going forward.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

I spoke with Bill who was initially helpful and was able to send out a technician quickly to have a look at what they were dealing with. After speaking with the technician he informed me a lot of work was required to get the stove up to code and in good working order. The technician also gave me a run down of all parts required.\n\nAfter speaking with Bill again he provided me with a quote and I agreed to have the work done. I left a 50% deposit and was awaiting for parts to come in before work could begin.\n\nDuring the month it took to get parts in I repeatedly had to call to get an update on when work could start. The answer was always the same, \"just give us a call back in a week or two if you don't hear from us\". When I'm the customer it should not be my responsibility to be constantly checking in. The final time I called to check on an install ETA I was told all part would be in the following week. The following week I called to confirm all parts had arrived and our scheduled Saturday install date was still a go. No one, including Bill could tell me if the parts had actually arrived. When I insisted I needed to know to plan my weekend I was told Bill was coming regardless (I guess all those parts were not needed after all, I was charged for them though).\n\nDuring the install Bill thought it was a good idea to discuss his employee that was working with him that day, the fact that the employee had only been on the job for 2 days, had a substance abuse issue, and other personal details. I was floored to be hearing this.\n\nAfter all new piping was installed Bill thought it would be a good idea to spray paint the pipes while installed getting flat black spray paint all over my almost new wood stove (just left it like that). Bill also said I needed a probe which was essentially a thermometer. I agreed as I no nothing about wood stoves and Bill went ahead and drilled a 1/4\" hole in the piping for the probe. When pressed where the probe was Bill said he didn't have any with him and that they were back ordered. Who drills a hole for a part they don't have? Bill told me I could easily pick one up on Amazon. Now I was left searching for a probe and I had to pay for it! I just paid him 4k for all the work.\n\nBill and his employee finished the job and left. The next day I noticed the woodstove now sounded like a jet engine with huge amounts of air now flowing through or sucking up the pipes. The noise was so unbearable we had to keep turning up the tv to block out the sound. Not to mention it was hard to keep a fire going.\n\nI reached out to Bill to let him know about the issue, Bill immediately told me it was the stove, nothing to do with the work he performed. I was surprised as he hadn't even looked at it yet and it made no sound previously. When asked what could be done, Bill told me he had no idea as he didn't know how to fix my particular brand of wood stove. I was shocked as he had agreed to previously do the work on it and I paid handsomely.\n\nI told Bill there must be something he could do. Bill told me to reach out to the manufacturer and tell them about the problem and see what they say. Again I was shocked as to why I was being asked to do their work. I know nothing about wood stoves which is why I hired an expert. Bill told me to tell them I installed the liner and not a professional. Bill also told me the particular manufacturer didn't like him since he dropped their brand. Essentially I was being asked to lie.\n\nRegretfully I agreed to email the company as Bill told me that would be the fastest. After not hearing back I started to get mad about the whole situation. I reached back out to Bill and asked for a partial refund as the  whole process with the Source was getting ridiculous, and unprofessional. I was offered nothing. After some back and forth, the Sources story changed at least 3 times (all documented in emails). I finally gave up and have reached out to another company to complete the job.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

The back street has wires overhanging so it’s too dangerous. (Estimator did not note this and it turns out it was not a problem because this is where they ended up parking).\n3. They then explain that the right way to do this is to take the old insulation out first instead of blowing on top. Would be around additional $1000. (Again, this is not something the estimator noted and we ultimately did not bother).\n\nI already booked the morning off, so after working through the hang ups, they did the work but broke the frame to the attic access and then tried to “fix” it with massive nails instead of finishing nails. Did a terrible job and the mitred corners no longer meet. The nails stuck out, one bent-over and the wood split so he stopped hammering. Ultimately didn’t install the crib which was quoted because they lost the nail gun and couldn’t build it. I then realized this was probably why they didn’t want to do the work that day.\n\nI sent pictures of the messed up attic hatch frame to the owner and he offered to send the guys back to fix it. I declined because I’d seen their quality of work by that point. The house was built in 1920’s so the finishings will not be easily replaceable.\n\nWas offered a $150 credit on the bill but no more because then they’d be “below cost”. I don’t really feel that’s my problem if they damaged my home but I ultimately accepted as I had to carry on with my life. Anyways, this was my experience.\n\nCheers.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Riley was extremely kind and listened to us. He assured us that our experience is not how his company is ran and was the result of certain employees who he’s heard similar stories about. He also assured us that these employees were being dealt with so that this would not be a problem in the future. He offered to have different workers come out and fix the problems left by flooring guy and we declined his offer. He also went through our billing with us and agreed that there were items that we should not have been charged. We weren’t expecting to get any money back, but he called us later and said he was putting a check in the mail. He again offered to send out someone to fix the problems, again we declined. I sincerely feel bad that the owner has to deal with issues like this and I hope that in the future his employees will represent Phoenix in the same professional manner that Riley has.\n\nI would never use Phoenix again, nor would I ever recommend them to family, friends, or enemies. If you decide to use them be sure to look over your estimate thoroughly, line by line. They will charge for services not rendered/products not delivered, and double charge for other items. When called out on this practice, Brian Heck explains this is the “industry standard”. They, Brian and Tyler, and their flooring subcontractor schedule appointments and are consistently late, every single appointment. Even to pick up final payment, Tyler couldn’t make the appointment on time. We were threatened with collections when we had another appointment scheduled at the time they were finally wanting to arrive. When called out on this, it is because we are in Payette. Our location was known when Phoenix took the job. If Phoenix doesn’t want to take jobs outside their comfort zone, then they need to let customers know that they don’t service that area. Their drywall/paint crew did do a great job. Overall impression is this company dishonest, unreliable, lacks respect for customers time. Customer service/satisfaction is definitely not their priority, making money on services not provided/products not provided are. Proceed with caution if you decide to hire Phoenix!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

We just wanted to house clean and dust free as we reiterated numerous times.\nWe spoke to Laura to coordinate and she even followed up via text message to confirm arrival and etc (Friday May 17th).\nCleaners came on Friday as booked (2 days after the windows were installed) and I reminded them again that we wanted the house cleaned and dustless especially on all the noticeable surface areas. They agreed and started right away and off to work I went.\nMy wife was WFH and mid way through the day she messaged me that some of the windows and sills were still dusty after the cleaner claimed she already cleaned that window.\nThe two cleaners combined 10-hours were up and they hurriedly left. I came home and checked and most were wiped down and mopped but areas I wanted them to clean (which I instructed) was not.\nI messaged Laura back (May 18th) regarding our displeasure with the cleaning along with photos to show and it's been almost a week with no response.\nSame photos sent to Laura attached here for reference.\nExtremely disappointed that what we paid to have done was not even close to what was expected.

Robert arrived and completed the inspection. He was informative and walked my husband through the process of using our insurance claim to get the needed repairs done to our home. The roofing crew arrived exactly at the time scheduled and had the entire roof shingles removed and replaced, in 10 hours.

Job workmanship was excellent.  Everyone I worked with was very helpful. Earnest the sales person was straight forward and did not do the car salesman routine--he gave me the estimate and other houses to look at in area.  And his estimate was the lowest on same materials--James Hardie siding.  The installers were very hard working and offered to help me with anything I was doing(this was outside the siding) one on the crew in particular seemed to be in charge (maybe a crew foreman)--think his name was Moses?  The crew worked very hard and fast because a snow storm was coming--when they left it started snowing--but new siding complete. The crew's supervisor Oswald was always very nice and when he came back to recheck what I had thought was a problem--he explained why it had been done differently.  While Oswald was here we heard my fire detector beeping in camper trailer--took the fire detector down and replaced the battery.  Also an outdoor light wasn't working--took globe off and replace light bulb now works.  Hard to find hard working people anymore but I am so glad I found them .

They came highly recommend to me by the elderly family who sold me the house.\n\nWhile the rest of the house was still circa 1930’s both fireplace, liners and chimneys were in excellent condition. It was a relief to be able to trust that A-1 would maintain them that way.\n\nOver the years technicians from A-1 have been,  unfortunately, confronted with a couple of snarky tenants despite previous arrangements being made. Instead of engaging , the technician apologized to the tenant (!) left the apartment  and called the office to indicate he’d not been able to clean the chimney. I was contacted by the office and instead of charging me for the technician’s time - which they could have argued was a reasonable thing to do- the manager assured me that waiting a couple of months until the tenant vacated would not affect the safety of the chimney as they were in excellent condition. This type of personal and professional consideration is deeply appreciated and clearly puts A-1 in a professional category far and above what we have come to experience over the past several years in the residential service  industry\n\nI have recommended A-1 to other neighbours and friends fortunate enough to have fireplaces and will continue to do so.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Our decision was made after talking to another window/siding company, considering several positive Mountain Safe Exteriors online reviews and getting a strong recommendation about Mountain Safe Exteriors from a neighbor. The installation work was top quality, careful project management ensured all work was completed on time, permitting and inspector signoff was accomplished with no rework, cleanup was flawless and, most importantly, the Mountain Safe installation and management teams were top notch communicators, responsive in every regard, always available to answer questions and most pleasantly engaging to work with. We met with several members of the management team at our home during the project, a surprising and welcome occurrence, as they each seemed available, genuinely concerned and responsive. Surprisingly, Dave Thomas – Founder and CEO visited onsite with us at the conclusion of work to make certain we were happy with the work done. Throughout the project Jon, Lonnie, Gilberto, Daniel, Cari and most especially Desi, made the project flow seamlessly. We have no idea if Desi ever rests, as she was always available to answer questions and keep us informed as to next steps. Our home is now energy efficient and lovely to look at once again. We believe you will enjoy working with this team if you engage Mountain Safe Exteriors for your window and/or siding project!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

They are by far the best contractors I have ever worked with and are all about customer satisfaction.\nDave Thomas sat down with me and went through design ideas and his vision far exceeded anything I could have come up with. Amy, from the office, coordinated the schedule beautifully.  They took down and reinstalled my blinds for window installation, which was completed in one day (12 windows (including two extremely large trapezoids), sliding glass door and front door), Alberto and his crew are machines and treated my house with total respect.  Jeff Jahner was extremely helpful and stayed on top of all my inquiries. Day after install, the painters came to paint frames, and window sills. Dominic Curtis was a perfectionist, he and Kenny went above and beyond to make sure everything was satisfactory.\nThen the siding crew came, again, Daniel’s crew were machines; they tore down my wood, soffits, facia, and gutters in no time and had the new repairs, wrap, siding, etc. put up in two days. Then the finishers came to beautify the nails, seams, install lights, etc. way beyond expectations.  They sent their specialist, John Jahner, to rebuild my front patio, with all new beams. Ed Nelson let me know what was happening and when to expect the next step.  He became my liaison, even though all were great with communication.\nJosé with the gutter installers rushed their schedule to fit my house in before the Memorial Day storms.\nAnd last, but not least, Logan was very professional with the final wrap up.\nIf any one of the crews saw something that needed a quick fix, boom, it was done, and every crew was very meticulous with the finishing touches, extremely professional work.\nMy house was literally transformed by MSE!  Forget the old adage…”you get what you pay for.” In my opinion, MSE delivers the highest quality work that one would expect only the wealthy could afford.\nSpecial shout out to Dave for your brilliant ideas and always being there!\n10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

However, on their first day on the job, Ramjack’s employees installed the straps horizontally, not vertically as their own designs had specified. Carbon fiber straps only work when applied vertically, and this mix up shows a lack of knowledge that is alarming from a company that claims to be a team of “Foundation Repair Experts.” I had to catch this error and follow up with the workers to get them to correct this fault in their work.\n\nBut the problems didn’t end there. When I went to refinish the basement a year and a half later, we found that despite Ramjack’s work, the center of the wall had shifted further in. After looking closer, I found that even on the second attempt, Ramjack’s employees still failed to install the carbon fiber straps effectively. Every bracket strap was loose, a few/couple were disconnected entirely, and the workers had pulled insulation in front of their own shoddy craftsmanship to conceal this unfinished work from us.\n\nIt is our belief and opinion that Ramjack’s workers decided not to complete the job to save time after initially installing the fiber straps incorrectly. Due to their deceit, we now have to pursue more extensive, and much more expensive foundation repair solutions.\n\nWe reached out to Ramjack to try to get this resolved, and their “solution” was to offer that, if we pay them $14,000 more for a new job, they will give us a discount on follow-up work as a concession for the previous issues.\n\nIf you are facing foundation concerns and looking for real, lasting solutions, do yourself a favor and steer clear of Ramjack. Their dishonesty, poor craftsmanship, and abysmal customer support are way below any semblance of professionalism.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

If you value your property and expect high quality work and to be respected as a customer, then avoid Black Tar.\n\nBlack Tar damaged my garage door and management (Ramy) has given me the run-around, avoided follow-ups and provided absolutely no resolution despite assuring me they will make it right.  This company talks a great game to sound good and get you off their back and then disappears and avoids accountability.\n\nI scheduled a simple sealing job and was told it would happen on a specific day. The morning of, they called to reschedule for the next day, but then showed up anyway without ringing the doorbell. My car was parked in the garage and I had to rush out to stop them after they had started and was forced to drive my car through wet sealant. The lead worker lied and said he knocked to say they were here —my Ring camera showed he did not. This level of dishonesty clearly reflects the company’s culture.\n\nAfter that, I found tar overspray on my garage door. Ramy assured me it could be cleaned without damage, and they sent the same negligent worker who made the mess in the first place. Instead of testing a small area, he used the wrong cleaner (not the one I was promised would be fine) and further damaged my door by stripping the coating and paint. Moreover, I had specified I wanted to be present when they did the cleaning and confirmed with the office an acceptable time that worked. They arrived 3 hours later than the agreed time and started while I was in a meeting. I had to run out to stop him before any more damage was done.\n\nAttempts to get this new damage resolved with Black Tar and Ramy have gone nowhere.  Calls and emails go unanswered.  I’m now left with a bad seal job (there are tire marks where I had to drive my car through wet seal and cracks they did not bother to fill), tar all over a new garage door and stripped paint in the middle of the door.\n\nThis company is just awful to deal with.  They don’t care about their customers or the quality of the work they do.  I keep getting emails from Black Tar that they are starting to do home renovations – I can’t even imagine how poor that work would be based on this awful experience.   Avoid Black Tar.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Their professionalism and customer service are beyond reproach.  They even ensured the hole was properly trimmed up so the new range top would fit perfectly!

Because of circumstances at my end, I met no one in person. After sending pictures, I received an estimate, signed the contract for the work and sent a deposit. A real leap of faith that worked out. Two workmen came and spent three days as promised, removing the old concrete (1955) stairs and verandah top, and rebuilding. The original base was solid and they parged all around it. They were unobtrusive, worked hard, and removed all debris, including the old railings. . Additionally, we agreed on a price to add new railings and I went with the companys suggestion, again, sight unseen.\nEverything, start to finish took 4 days. No unexpected costs. No disruptions at home. And free advice on best products to use on winter ice. Everything seems good and solid, with a years warranty. I would recommend Megacity for your concrete work.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Diehl also was an immense help choosing the color and stamp to fit the patio space we had. Very noteworthy is that they were on time everyday and finished exactly when they said they would. The qualty of product (concrete, rebar) far surpassed any expectations I had and surpassed every quote i recieved (I got 5 quotes) and his pricing was very competitive .

Because this A-frame cabin is rented, I can't ensure what wood is being burned or how well the fireplace insert we added to increase efficiency was being cleaned. Annual-- biannual cleaning and inspection by Chimney Sweeps has kept this primary heat source functioning at its best. I love their service, communication, the report comes complete with pictures of the inside of the fireplace and chimney so areas of possible issue can be tracked from year to year for change. Great combination of old technology (brush scrubbing) and new (video close up inspection).\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

I had water damage under my home and in my kitchen. They were great about answering my questions and putting my mind at ease. I'm happy to give them 5 stars!\n\nTwo years has gone by since Standard Restoration completed an awesome job of cleaning up water damage under my home.\n\nI called Standard Restoration to look at a couple things under my home after an inspection was done and the inspector found some staining left behind in a small spot, my HVAC was sitting on the ground, and some lining was out of place. Dan was very nice to talk with and sent out Taylor and Jake to take a look. They strapped up the HVAC system, smoothed out the water barrier lining and resprayed the stained wood even though it was just fine. No charge to me.\n\nThis company really stands by their work!! Both Taylor and Jake were professional, helpful in answering my questions, and respectful.\n\nI was pleased with Standard Restoration's work 2 years ago and even more pleased now. If I could give 10 stars I would. Thank you guys for all your hard work!!!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Driveway, back patio, and hot tub pad with exposed aggregate.  I found the owner Silvio to be easy to talk to and he was happy to walk through my ideas with me and offer suggestions which I ended up taking a few times.  I must have had over a dozen different crew members work on various stages of this project and all were polite, professional and respectful of keeping things clean.  Due to this, my wife and I made sure that they all kept hydrated and well snacked, every day.  My wife and I were very impressed with one of the concrete formers who worked in 40+C heat all day long and did fantastic detailed work despite the heat.  No shortcuts. No rushing. **Turns out it was Silvio's son! **\n\nThere was a \"sub boss\" of sorts who showed up once or twice and always met me with a smile and did not get annoyed with my questions and suggestions.  Easy to talk to. ** Turns out that was SIlvio's brother! **\n\nConcrete is an art-form and there are some irregularities in certian areas that I'm sure they will address. **They did!\n\nI'm not sure why you would want to hire any other company.  They are not only the biggest name in the area, the skill demonstrated by the crew was nothing short of masterful.

He spoke to me with nothing but respect and didn't talk to me like most men talk to woman. Like we wouldn't understand.  He explained everything as he went, was fair in his price and did the job in less then 24 hours from our 1st encounter.

A site super always came by to see how things were going and if his staff or I needed anything!\nCleanup was thorough and the full job very well done!!\nThank you Belvidere!!\n\nPina\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

My husband and I purchased a new build house and after living in it for 6 months we had our first basement flood.  It has now been 2 and a half years of battling with the builder to fix our basement flooding problem with no avail.  Two and a half years of having to deal with water intrusion every time it rained truly took a toll on myself and my family.  I finally decided to call Liftech and not only were we able to get an inspection quickly, but we then were able to schedule the repair dates quickly too!  Neil Whitehead was the first person we met with Liftech and he was so knowledgeable, friendly and patient when explaining the process to us.  His sincerity that he truly understood our problem and his confidence that Liftech and their crew could fix our problem once and for all made us secure in our decision to hire them.  The next individual we met was Austin Parr, he was the Superintendent assigned to our job and he truly is an amazing asset to Liftech!  He explained every step of the process to us, was extremely patient with all of our worries, concerns and incessant questions.  He was extremely knowledgeable in all areas of our job consistent with basement concrete, drainage, grading, sump pumps, water flow, joints, stress points, etc.  We learned so much not just from Austin but also from Blake Pendry who was also another important asset who worked on our site. Blake and the crew were always on time and would give us a synopsis as to what would be done each day. I wish I could remember every one of the crew members names because they all were tremendous and worked so hard!  It was quite a feat to trench into our basement several linear feet then put into place proper piping for drainage, remove our old builder grade sump pump and install a new herculean sump pump and then put everything all back together!  The crew went above and beyond to always keep the area clean; they secured the area by hanging plastic sheeting and frequently vacuumed the area from dust and debris. They removed large chunks of broken concrete via buckets.  Every single member of our crew was always professional and very friendly.  I truly thank everyone of them wholeheartedly!  Even now that we have been 2 months past completion, I have called on Austin when I have a worry or concern or question in regard to the proper functioning of the system that they installed.  He has gone above and beyond to squeeze in an appointment for us to come and check our system to make sure everything is working properly.\nFor two and a half years we waited on the builder of our home to do the right thing, to fix a severe problem with their product that they sold to us, but they would not. Instead, it was Liftech that fixed our problem. They are indeed a company that takes pride in their work, they value their clients as well as their employees.  Thank you again to everyone who worked on our job, we are grateful to you all!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Spent an hour to hear babble and try to twist our arms ... If they have to push the sales so much then what's wrong with the product.

Andre listened to our concerns, identified our needs and walked us through our options; with no pressure tactics or overselling.  Scheduling the work was quick, even with a one week delay due to a vehicle issue, and completed sooner than I expected.  On the day of installation the crew's first priority was protection of our home finishes, entering only with booties on and protective runners in place.  The 2nd priority was assessing the site conditions of our home, which ended up not being ideal for the work that had been quoted.  So with some quick brainstorming between site and the shop, the team came up with a Plan B on the spot.  Although not the exact system we were originally sold on, this plan eliminated risk to the project, minimized mess and debris inside our finished basement and provided me with the end result that I was looking for.  Andre re-visited the site to understand the issues at hand, provide us with more reassurance and let us know that there would be a credit provided to account for the difference between the original plan and the new solution.  The entire experience was pleasurable and professional.  I highly recommend Omni Basement Systems to anyone who has a wet basement issue or loses any sleep worrying about one.  Peace of mind is priceless.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

He did not try to upsell me in any way and was very clear and straightforward...I appreciated that approach, especially since I had several other bidders who tried to include extravagant extras. Travis kept in touch with me while I awaited HOA approval and once approved, he scheduled a time convenient for me and his crew came out to do the job. They arrived on-time (which is unheard of for some contractors/subcontractors), and they were extremely respectful, neat, and productive...they immediately put down plastic to cover all walkways, and they kept me aware of everything that was going on step-by-step. Halfway through the job, a Structural Solutions inspector came out just to ask me if I was happy with the job so far and if there was anything else that I may need \"WOW\" what a surprise!!! The job was completed (in 1 day) and I was, and am, very very satisfied. I would recommend this company to anyone in need of this or any other service they provide.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

We waited over seven months to have our house painted by Greg Unseth Painting. We requested gloss paint and in three different conversations with Garret, he assured us the paint would be gloss. Due to a family death, we were out of town when the painter completed the job and we paid the invoice over the phone. We had no idea that the paint was not gloss, but satin. Upon our return, my husband contacted Garret to inform him the paint was not gloss. Garret said he had made an error and ordered the wrong paint. He apologized and told my husband that because the job was under warranty, they would come repaint the house with the correct paint. Surprisingly, sometime between Garret talking to my husband and him discussing it with his boss, he somehow “remembered” telling us about the gloss paint problems. Very shortly thereafter, Greg Unseth himself called to tell us all the reasons he doesn’t like to use gloss paint. That was the first time we had ever heard this from anyone. The paint job was already done, so we agreed to move on, even though we really wanted gloss, not satin, paint. Mr. Unseth did agree to repaint the trim at his “cost” and said he would call the next day with an estimate. He never called back and we ended up calling his office a week later. Garret told us the cost was going to be almost $1,600 (we had already paid about $7,000 for the original job). One would have thought they would have been happy to just have to paint some trim and not the whole house. We were not willing to pay this amount and were basically told by Greg Unseth, through Garret, to get an attorney. We did not get what we paid for and agreed to. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone. Very shady business practices.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

They connected with us throughout the project, confirming different stages of the construction to ensure it was meeting our requirements. The following work was completed on a factory loft renovation:\n-Demolition of concrete counters, and kitchen cabinetry, drywall and two bathrooms\n-Framing of several rooms, including structural steel beams and posts to support a floating mezzanine bedroom\n-Rough in and drains for 2 bathrooms\n-Removal of 3 layers of paint and restoration of interior brickwork to its original patina and industrial look\n-Concrete floor levelling and repairs\n-Disposal and cleanup.\n\nFeargus’ impeccable project management and building experience kept this project on track and it was completed ahead of schedule. Every member of this crew worked together, respected our neighbours and treated our home like it was their own. They really got into the project at every stage.\n\nThis team took the place of a 20+ (now retired) crew of trades we’ve worked with on many projects. Naturally we were apprehensive about starting with an entirely new team. We were so happy with their work we’ve decided to contract this team immediately for another project we decided to start this spring.\n\nThe cost of this job was on par with comparable quotes. However, the extra distance, quality standards and ability to understand this unique project sets Self Build Canada apart from their competitors.\n\nI would gladly recommend Self Build Canada and plan to rehire them for future projects!\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

I have had so much work done to my house and this one was by far the best experience.  Provided an estimate to raise my Porch, Service walk, Driveway, Garage and service door stoop.  Some need to be raised in excess of 2\".  The quote was reasonable and they pointed some concerns no one else did.  The Garage was a tricky job from the start. They stated up front what he experienced in past jobs.  Knowing all of the issues I went ahead and rolled the dice. The slab went up north of 2\" making the service door usable again but the garage still puddled, but about 75% less than it did before.  The funny thing here is Trevor was not happy, but I was still elated!  This is why this company is the best.  Listen to the man. He does not promise what he cannot do and takes the work seriously. As if every job is his own.  From the phone call requesting an estimate to the completion of the work, each and every person i encounter were respectful and a delight to work with. Hands down 5+ star business and experience.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

The pavers have been installed at the yard for years so you can see how they look over time, and the designs there gave me ideas. Also--the stone masons worked steadily daily until the job was done.

It took us a couple of months to finalize our order.  Weshna remembered us and quoted me by phone.  Once we were ready to go it took about 3 weeks to complete.  The measurements were taken but the counter didn't come in.  I contacted Weshna and she got everything sorted out.  Despite a couple of hiccups (first counter was cracked) the installation team (who were amazing) got it all done by my deadline and we had our countertop and backsplash installed by Christmas.

I really liked that I could choose to buy or not buy the install or measuring services from Stone on the go, since I was comfortable measuring by myself. Installation was fast and happened within a week of placing my order!

It was a great experience from start to finish.  Here are some details of the project.\n\nFirst, Joe Latella was the Account Manager that worked with us and put together the quote.  It was very detailed, which we appreciated, and he clearly explained all of our options along with the pluses and minuses.  We wound up going with an elastomeric paint on our stucco surface.  It was more expensive, but we will get at least five more years out of the paint job.  We also used their recommended color consultant, Meg Barry.  She was excellent and really helped us select the right colors.\n\nThe crew was excellent and very respectful of our property.  One of the things that I liked is they don't split crews up between multiple jobs.  The foreman, Victor, and his team were there for the full job.  We didn't get new people being swapped in every day, so we got consistent quality.  And speaking of quality, they did an outstanding job.  Our property is difficult... three stories high with a lot of outcroppings, balconies, and accents.  A number of windows needed woodwork, we had iron gates that needed to be treated, and wood lattice work that needed staining.  They were all done with attention to detail, and they came out beautiful.\nWe had one issue with paint selection during the job, and Victor came to us with a recommended solution.  He nailed it.\n\nMy only minor complaint is in regards to their loyalty program where you get discounts on future jobs.  My issue isn't with that, it is that they don't disclose that half the money goes to a faith-based non-profit organization started by their founder to build an evangelical church in Ethiopia. I'm sure it is a worthy cause, but we would prefer to choose our own charitable organizations, so we passed on the membership.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

I was told she will call on the product as soon as her associate finished checking on a product that supplier had called for her to check on. !5 to 20 minutes later that associate came back and informed her he was doing something else for a customer. Approximately 15 to twenty more minutes passed when he returned with the news she was waiting for.  I waited while she called to give Summit the news and checked on my product. She said it will be a bit before they call back because they are busy.  ALL TO SAVE HER THE TIME OF MAKING AN EXTRA PHONE CALL ?????

I had a entrance to my basement that had a drain that would not drain out.  Oshan came out and gave me an estimate to put in a sump pump to solve the issue.  While it was not cheap, there are not a lot of companies out there doing this type of work.  I expected it to be top notch.\n\nOlshan came out and began the work and unfortunately, hit out water main going to our house.  We shut down our water and they called an emergency plumber to come out and fix the issue.  The water line is not up to current code standards and should not have been located where it was.  This was not the fault of Olshan but they did the right thing and got things fixed up quickly.\n\nThe next day they installed the sump pump.  There were several things I was unhappy with and in retrospect, I should have stopped the job there and discussed how things should have moved forward.  I was able to along the way express my displeasure with the exact way things were being done and get some accommodations.  However, in the end the sump pump had a cover that stuck up over the concrete by over an inch and had wires that just came out the top of it.  There was a significant trip hazard that was not in the middle of my basement landing.  Needless to say, I was upset with the solution and reached out to Olshan after the fact.  I had paid a premium price for a sub par solution.\n\nAfter some back and forth with Olshan, they offered to fix the problem issue and we brainstormed some solutions.  Kelly is one of the main engineers and came out and worked with me to discuss a solution.  Mind you the original work was done in November.  The final work to complete the job properly did not occur until March.  It was not urgent so I did not push but do believe Olshan would have accommodated a quicker turn around had it been a priority for me.\n\nThe long story short is that Olshan fixed their flawed original design to better meet my expectations.\n\nWould I engage with Olshan again?  I definitely would.  They did not get things correct the first time in more ways than one, but they were nice, polite, and eager to make their customers satisfied.  What would I do differently in the future?  Make sure you have a very clear understanding of the solution they are intending to implement.  Ask for pictures or drawings or at least a discussion to be sure that their expectations are meeting your expectations.  And finally, if/when things go wrong, let Olshan know you are unsatisfied and they will make it right.\n\nWas it a perfect execution?  No.  Did everything get fixed in the end?  Yes.  Not a perfect execution but a more than ideal imperfect experience with a satisfactory outcome.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Sam was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and thoroughly explained the problems he saw and his recommended fixes. He pointed us to some examples of his work and worked up an estimate for the work needed to ensure the integrity of the foundation. We were so impressed with the examples of his work that we requested a more expensive repair to ensure that we achieved the professional aesthetic of his past work. Sam sent us an updated contract and worked us into his schedule quickly. The quality of the finished product looked fantastic. Sam returned a few days later to check on how the foundation was curing and noticed a couple of areas he wasn’t happy with. He didn’t have the cement to make the repairs that day but returned the next afternoon to complete the repairs. Customer satisfaction is Sam’s number one goal and it shows. We wholeheartedly recommend Parging Pros and are already planning on using them again for some stair repairs we need.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

My house is 55 years old and replacing bricks with something similar would have been difficult or impossible. Even with the weird split in the bricks, the planter looks lovely.\nThey did less well on tuck pointing areas near the ground and step that had been damaged by salt. The tuck pointing they did does not match the older mortar.

The guys were friendly, helpful, humorous and they finished the job in one day and the windows look wonderful.\nOnly regret is that I didn't think to ask for frosted glass in the master bedroom and bathroom.

We had to arrange for someone to be home (3 separate times) & then to not even receive a call saying they wouldn't be there is ridiculous! The first-time they blamed us said we wrote it down wrong & then later blamed it on a computer glitch. The second time they were overbooked & the last time they lied and said the time was for later in the afternoon. We had written down each appointment on a calendar and scheduled it in the calendar app on my phone. The owner seems nice when you talk to him but if you REALLY want your chimney cleaned I would schedule with a company that will ACTUALLY keep their appointment with you, especially if you have to take time off work to be there.\nAgain, a call would have been nice.\n*A kid did show up late on the final appointment (after we canceled because they had not shown up on time) & the kid was really nice but he showed up without a ladder & we were upset about the whole ordeal so we will just find another company at this point.\nUPDATE:  After the owner read this review he called & threatened my grandma with legal action. He was definitely & completely unprofessional. Threatening people for an honest review...wow, just wow.  Good luck with your legal action.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

Overall quality is beautiful in the concrete, with some small aesthetic issues on the metal siding they added between the concrete and our siding.\n\nI'm very glad we went with this company, they were flexible on timing and Carlos was fantastic, professional, and provided gorgeous concept artwork to help us envision the changes. We have additional work planned for next summer and will 100% go with them again.\n\nOur original brick patio had severely eroded, and once the work began they realized the original contractor had used a different kind of filler rock under the bricks that was really atypical and poor quality. They had not dug deep enough on the initial assessment to find this out, so our budget increased significantly to remove the old filler and bring in the appropriate quality, but Carlos communicated well and was flexible with how to approach that change order.\n\nOur original foundation was also poured strangely which they had to work around, and unfortunately the contractors on site had made some offhand comments (maybe trying to joke? Possible language barrier) that  we would have a MASSIVE upcharge and may have to completely redo our entire yard and should just do an easy fix to patch it \"then sell the house\". We panicked until Carlos reviewed the needed changes and confirmed that wasn't the case, there were other options that yes would require an additional cost but would be absolutely appropriate and fix the issues without a complete redo. I wish they hadn't said anything and just let Carlos communicate.\n\nAs a part of the foundation issue they added a metal barrier between our house siding and the concrete and in places it is not very clean, but isn't very noticeable and is purely aesthetic.\n\nThe team was very professional and clean and left our yard in great shape except for anticipated traffic wearing on the grass with so much back and forth. I wish I had known that we'd have to basically resod the path they took back and forth going in to the project.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

I said I knew and that that was one reason I had called them, since I had already opened up my AC unit and hadn’t noticed anything but a little mild growth in the drip pan, not a big deal, and not something a UV light can kill (unless, as other reviewers have noted, it is strong enough to harm the system itself). The guy talked down to me, saying “No, don’t ever let anyone sell you on something they don’t show you. Come look.” I had already seen. I tried to tell him that, but I wanted to throw him out right then. Don’t sell to me in my own home. That’s a total invasion of the sanctity of the home.\n\nThen their technician was unwilling to leave until I had tried to call the company numerous times to explain. I was beginning to think I would have to resort to legal measures when he started clicking on my phone that I was holding in my hand and lingering, wanting to hear the call. After the third time I left a voicemail and said, “There ya go! Bye!” He finally left.\n\nTheir owner, Shalom, called me, frustrated with me for turning away his employees without a dime. He said 99% of his customers don’t have the problem I was having. I can see from these reviews and the ones on the BBB that he was lying. At the time, I explained to him that it is not unreasonable for someone who knows nothing about HVAC systems and air duct cleaning to think that when you say “$99 per furnace air duct cleaning” you mean the entire air system, or certainly, at least the furnace.\n\nBut, unlike everyone else, I had the wherewithal to call my handyman friend and realize I didn’t want them to do anything at my house. I sent them home and have Patriot Pros, a pricier company that has done excellent work for me in the past, to come fix everything in one fell swoop the right way.\n\nSV Air moved a Fu Dog statue in the front of my house as well, and I really did not appreciate that. That is a spiritual ward I have protecting my home that they should have asked me to move, not done on my behalf. They had the statue misplaced and facing the wrong direction when I discovered it after they left.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

There's a whole team that works together to get your job done. Big enough company to specialize but small enough that they all work together.  From first estimator, to scheduler, to PM, to the actual guys on the ladders.\nBy the way, all the folks I worked with live up here, in the Fort Collins area. This is the 2nd house, on my street they have painted this summer.\nAlso, everyone is just so pleasant to work with. They did a great job of explaining ALL the little extras they were going to do. They have a great tool to help you visualize what the final paint will look like and that is helpful for us, but also for having something to send to my HOA. Highly recommend.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

He called us or texted us each day of the project, sending pictures and updates. He even let us know when there was a slight delay due to cold temperatures.

The team we had the pleasure of dealing with were Cody, Rafael and Aaron . They were professional and took the time to explain and answer all our questions. They were very neat and cleaned up after each day. We were very impressed with the level of service we received. The basement, although old looks 100 times better.

The team at Gerry's was phenomenal. Our initial walk was completed with Dave and it couldn't have been a better experience, Dave spent the time going through the whole project with me and building timelines. He continued to check in all throughout the process. The team in the office (Kayla) was great with keeping me updated on the process and crews schedules. The roofing team assigned the Job were polite, punctual and informative. Most importantly, the clean up was really well done. The post work inspection and follow up by the team after the work was much appreciated and I think more companies should do follow ups for feedback with clients and learn from it. Bernadette was eager to hear our feedback and happy to take things back to the team. Gerry's roofing and Siding Inc has been around for quite some time and after my experience it's easy to see why! I would happily refer them to family and friends and will likely be in contact for future projects.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

As to the actual job which was refurbishment of the exterior of our wooden front door, they sanded it down, stained it (after spending time with us picking the right color), and put two coats of clear-coat on to make it look better than new.  We were again extremely pleased with the work.  Matt, the owner, came by several times during the work to make sure everything was being accomplished as planned. He was concerned that we were satisfied at every step!  After the work was complete, they told us how to keep the door looking it’s best in the years ahead - very much appreciated!\n\nWe strongly recommend this company!

He repaired two appliances, my Viking hood as well as my Kitchenaid refrigerator.  He cleaned  up his work area and offered to answer any questions that we had.

The very next day after we called for general information, Mike came out and did a site survey and gave us a couple of different estimates for a few different options later that same day. Pricing was steep but on par with the other estimates we had gotten and Peak Fencing seemed way more legit than the other companies we had previously reached out to. They initially told us it would be about 3-4 weeks before they could actually do the work but it only ended up being 2 weeks. Chain link removal and wooden fence installation was done by a sub-contractor separate from Peak Fencing on one day and then the Peak Fencing guys came out a few days later to install the automatic gate. Had a minor technical difficulty solar panel on day 1 (was installed in the late afternoon and didn’t get enough sunlight before it got dark and couldn’t open in the morning) but Dave was super responsive and came by immediately to make sure everything was fixed and working properly. Haven’t had any issues since and we are definitely pleased with the work and company overall. They charge a small percentage fee for paying with cards (which can end up being a few hundred dollars depending on the size of your project) but offer a $100 discount if you pay with cash so definitely ask about that.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

The showroom was so warm,  inviting and each fireplace was set up as if you were in a room. I could actally visualize what it would be like in our cottage. I saw one that I thought would be perfect and after speaking with Jodie and Kim who were incredibly knowledgeable I knew I had found the perfect one. It was just the right size and BTU'S for our little piece of heaven on Lake Superior.\nJodie made it all happen for us. A month later my husband drove to Ottawa and they loaded up the well packaged and secured the unit onto his pickup and sent a very happy husband on his way.\nWe couldn't be happier and grateful to the staff at Hubert's for helping us make it all happen and keeping us warm this winter up in the Great White North.\n\nThank you Jodie, Kim, Rob and Kyle\n\nHolly and Hal and the Pupperonies\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

They also filled my radon pipe with concrete, and when I called the Forman he yelled at me and came to my house and pointed his finger in my face while yelling and then never did anything. I had to pay for a whole new system.\n\nTwo years later, water came back though the sealed crack and the corner they secured sank again. I called several times and finally they sent someone out. He took several measurements and said he would get back to me in two weeks. He never did. I contacted him and never heard back, then I contacted the company twice, they said someone would get back to me and again silence.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

They were able to start two weeks after we got the quote. The patio was the full width of the house, and it took them three and a half days from start to finish. They were on time, polite, accommodating, and respectful of us being at home the whole time the job was going on. The quality and attention to detail was top notch. If you're looking for an accountable crew to give you great concrete work at a fair price, Diehl Concrete is my recommendation.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

The quote and pricing we received could not be beat! Very satisfied with the job that was done. Rob was very helpful in providing a quote and answering our questions. The only criticism I could offer is I wish there was some more communication, as material had to be reordered when the initial colour didn't match. We had put down a deposit in March and the job wasn't completed until mid summer. From the time that we realized the colour didn't match, to waiting for the new material to arrive, we didn't hear anything for a few months until I personally reached out and asked for an update. I understand there was some change over in their customer service department, so I know blips happen! It's possible we just got lost in the shuffle. Overall we are satisfied and would recommend Gerry's to anyone needing their services.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

The salt water alternative seemed like a great idea. However, after doing some research, I came to the conclusion that salt water wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. You burn through way more cartridges than the sell you on, which drives the cost way high, and the salt residue around the spa isn’t so good for your concrete and landscaping. In the end the salt water tub just turns the salt intro chlorine anyway. So I walked into Spa Brokers and met with Brent. Brent was very transparent and helpful and I could tell that he was giving me the best deal possible. I ended up buying a Marquis Vector 94l. Due to Covid, it took a while to be delivered, but it was worth the wait. One of the jets had a flaw from the factory, and I was missing some brackets, however Brent and Phaedra replaced the jet and bracket without question and the delivery and set up was simple and easy. Spa brokers also gives you a complete starter kit. Brent even worked with me when I wanted to swap out the expensive boomerang lifter with a under mount side open cover lifter.

We primarily interfaced with Ritchie who was very professional and responsive. He provided a great run down of options we had and price points for each of them to allow us to basically add to the scope as we felt was appropriate. I asked many questions to clarify the scope and to understand why and when and where something was needed, and Ritchie was patient, detailed, and honest in his answers and was never dismissive or evasive. His team showed up on time and the work turned out great and exceeded our expectations. They even generously caulked the concerning gaps at the flashing around the chimney base for free, to hold it over until a roof replacement in the spring. We will absolutely work with Ritchie and the others at Idaho Fireplace and Chimney again for any future projects!\n\nProject Cost (only an estimate for those reading this) = $1430.00 (1 day)\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}

I was going to wait until the roof was paid off before doing this but I felt everyone should know. I was quoted $46,000 I trusted them from cambridge all good.\n\nThey took on my second home in drumbo my home leaked all through Christmas after they did some of the roof, I called and complained. They kept coming at night, I have no idea why I told them come in daylight. I had they're guy assuming I poured water down the roof vent, I was insulted. It was a rainy wet winter. I told them I wanted it done by October we were in January.\n\nThen they're guy who probably was smoking too much pot said they're isn't anything they can see. I started renovating underneath in the home to find out I had paid for the trusses to be repaired if there was damage. I had a few collapsed in my attic. I fixed what I could. They're big boss frank gave me a call and said it's fine, I told him save his trip I'll send pictures. Then he gave me $1000 prepaid visa cards. I'm not stupid You'll write them off.\n\nThen when it came to finishing the roof they took the pot smoker off and gave me Carlos. The goofs put up the wrong colour drip edge, told me they'd fix it later. By May I settled with just painting it so I didn't have to see them.  Let's not forget when they're employee fell through my ceiling on my bed. I didn't see any ropes, wonder what the ministry would say about this. The roof still leaks every now and then. They never answered us after the last leak. I'm just gonna shovel the snow off the roof. Incompetent roofers, my 14 year old son knows more.\n\nTo top it off, I feel they're payment plan was poorly explained and I think everyone should know. I told them they're preying on people old ladies, elderly and I didn't respect it. I pay 585/month. It's term is 60 months, they make it sound like it'll be done in 60 but no it's done in 180 months. That's 15 years. By then you've paid for it twice and some.\n\nNo wonder they can afford they're guy that just drives around and fixes things. Despicable company, shameful and frankly disgusting.  Once I pay this off, I hope I never see them again. I'm in business and understand the need to make money but can't respect outright lying and taking advantage of people and situations.\""}]}],"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","temperature":0.1}}}
