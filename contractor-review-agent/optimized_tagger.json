With this being a recently purchased home, I expected soot and a cracked liner, but instead got wildlife. Mace found a raccoon living in my chimney like it was an Airbnb with a five-month lease. He handled the removal like a pro, got everything cleaned up, and now I can finally use my fireplace raccoon-free and ready for winter. Would 100% call again!",
