## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't want to be listed" | We only feature positive content. But we can remove you if you prefer. |
| "What do you charge?" | Basic listing is always free. Premium is $X/month if you want more visibility. |
| "How is this different from Yelp?" | We don't have pay-to-play. Your ranking is based on reviews, not ad spend. |
| "I already have enough work" | Great! Your profile helps customers find you instead of calling 5 contractors. |
| "My reviews aren't all perfect" | We focus on patterns. A few negative reviews with good responses actually build trust. |

---

## Legal Considerations

- All data from public Google reviews
- Contractors can request removal (but why would they?)
- Clear disclosure: "Based on analysis of public reviews"
- No false claims about endorsement
- Verified badge only after claim confirmation
