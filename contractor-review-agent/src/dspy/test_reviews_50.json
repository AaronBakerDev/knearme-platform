The ownership was very responsive to my initial call and subsequent queries. He answered all my questions thoroughly and ensured I understood my options. The Confident Coatings team did an outstanding job  and made the house look new. They were quick and professional. The workers cleaned up all materials in the area. I was very impressed. Even my neighbors expressed what a great job Confident Coatings did on my house. In addition to the superb work, Confident Coatings was reasonably priced. I am very pleased with the results, would recommend them to everyone, and would use them again. I give Confident Coatings an A+ in all areas.",

We were told by a few other fireplace retailers that all we could get was a small insert, but Mike removed our old gas log set and housing and put in a full gas fireplace (see the before and after pictures). It fills the whole space and has a much larger viewing area than a small insert would have. Mike is talented at updating and retrofitting and does his best to make sure things come out  right.\n\nThere was some delay in the project due to ordering and delivery taking longer than expected, but that was fairly well communicated. In the grand scheme of things, the delay was not a big deal because the work was well done. The storefront staff are polite and helpful and the pricing is competitive. In the future, we will return to Mike and Front Range to have our other gas log fireplace updated.",

    "review_text": "I recently hired them for a cleaning session prior to a move. After seeing all the positive Google reviews, I was elated they were able to clean on such short notice but I left the experience with over $300 out-of-pocket for a service I could have done myself & an angering interaction with Leo.\n\nPositives:\n- Very communicative\n- Polite cleaner\n- Prompt\n- Cleaned windows well\n\nCons:\n- For a \"deep clean\", seems very sparse on the amount of supplies brought to the unit.\n- The same Swiffer mop cover was used for the floor in addition to the walls & windows (very unhygienic)\n- I indicated before the booking to Leo that I had hardwood floors so the appropriate solutions were brought, nothing was applied & the floors were just cleaned/mopped with water\n- My family member was in the unit & let me know about the lack of cleaning with the oven & unit. I called Leo an hour in & he was very unpleasant to speak to. He condescendingly told me that I should have waited till the end of the cleaning to provide feedback. Which I did not do for a few of reasons:\n1. The cleaner was already on site & my family member was there for the sake of organizing some things around the home & letting the cleaner in & needed to be elsewhere later on\n2. I had no idea if the cleaner had a booking afterwards & could not afford for her to come back later on, disrespect her schedule &  we were moving in the next day so did not have time for them to come back.\n3. Despite him saying \"you should wait until she's finished\", the cleaner was going room-by-room, so by the time she left to start cleaning another room, she was completed cleaning the prior, which seems more than fair for someone to provide feedback on at that point.\n\nLeo then proceeded to tell me that the cleaner communicated my family member was \"following her around the unit, making her uncomfortable & preventing her from doing her job\", which was infuriating considering the only time my family member was in the same room with her was when she was cleaning the windows as my family member VERY kindly held aside all the curtains for her so they would not get wet with water or get in the way when the cleaner was cleaning. The way he spoke about my family member was completely unacceptable & truly disgusting behaviour.\n\nThere were also issues with the oven not being cleaned properly & issues with rust. That being said, the issues with rust did not in-fact turn out to be solvable that day & Leo (to his credit), did provide clear information & updates on this (via text with video & pictures). That being said, it's worth noting, when the cleaner went back a second time & was asked to actually wipe down the inside of the oven (which I PAID EXTRA for in the booking), she seemed surprised it was even dirty despite \"cleaning\" it already. & when she was circling back to it, Leo had texted his cleaner was \"looking into it\" when she had already apparently finished cleaning it, which I had responded \"she should have caught the first time\". Also ironic given that he had just yelled prior on the phone about not giving feedback until the end despite her working room-by-room.\n\nLastly, despite it being only a 2 bed, 2 bath, & indicating it was within the range of 900+ sq ft on the booking website, the website did not suggest extra time. I can appreciate the cleaner did stay a little over time most likely to having to \"re-clean\" the oven (could have been avoided if she did it the first time) but she did not end up cleaning a whole room & bathroom after 4.5 hours at the unit (950 sq feet) which is wild considering the lack of cleaning that was done & how the unit was already was in \"good\" shape.\n\nRecommendation: Do NOT hire Toronto Shine Cleaning, there are better people suited for the job.",

Replaced 2 sprinkler heads, plus something else I don't know the name of, got everything turned on and some zoning issues resolved. Couldn't have asked for better service or a better price. Will definitely use again if I run into any more problems, and would highly recommend for anyone who needs sprinkler work done! I also appreciate that he didn't try to sell me on anything or replace things that didn't need replacing just to get more money. Overall we are very happy with the service provided.",

    "review_text": "Reached out to Accent Landscapes for a landscape design for our retirement home build in Cordera.  Roger Haywood asked for some information to get an idea of what we were specifically looking for.  We had no idea since we never had a home built and didn’t know what would really grow here.  Roger and his landscape designer took a draft landscape plan that I had developed and helped us transform the plan that would meet Cordera HOA rules and regulations.  We had a very specific budget since we used a lot of our additional money for upgrades inside our new home.  Within two weeks he sent us a proposed design with some very beautiful trees and foliage that would really enhance our yard.  Roger was very professional and patient with us since as I kept making change after change during the process.  He was very quick to respond when called or emailed.  Highly recommend Accent Landscapes for all your design and install needs regardless of what neighborhood you are purchasing a spec home or a new build.  We will definitely reach out to Accent for all our future landscape design needs.  I spoke with about 11 other landscapers in the area, some of who said my budget (40K) was too small for their services, but not one time did Accent Lanscapes say anything about our budget.  Thanks Roger for all that you have done for us.  We cannot wait to see the design come to life in a couple of months.",
