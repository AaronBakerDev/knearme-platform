# Session Log — 2025-12-12

- Status: Complete
- Context: Ahrefs Analytics installation
- Tools: Local CLI

## Actions Taken
- Added Ahrefs Analytics script to the global Next.js `<head>` so it loads on all pages (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
- Included `data-key="GCARehXOSg7IdQjlq/DD3Q"` per Ahrefs install guide.
- Ran `npm run lint`; failures were pre-existing and unrelated to the analytics change.

## Follow-ups / Next Steps
- Re-run Ahrefs “Recheck installation” after deploying to production.
