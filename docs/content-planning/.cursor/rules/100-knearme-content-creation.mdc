# kNearme Content Creation Guidelines

This document provides guidance for creating content that follows kNearme's structured approach across all service categories.

## Voice and Tone

- **Authoritative but accessible**: Demonstrate expertise without being overly technical

## Content Structure Standards

### All content should follow this general structure:

1. **Engaging introduction** (hook + problem statement + solution preview)
2. **Main content body** (structured with clear H2 and H3 headings)
3. **Practical applications** (how-to sections, checklists, actionable advice)
4. **Visual supplements** (diagrams, photos, illustrations as appropriate)
5. **Conclusion with next steps** (summary + recommended actions)
6. **CTA relevant to content level** (contractor search, related guides, etc.)
