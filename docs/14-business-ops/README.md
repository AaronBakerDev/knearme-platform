# Business Operations Framework

This folder defines how KnearMe runs as a business. Product is only one lane.
We need clear ownership, inputs/outputs, and escalation across functions.

## Goals

- Build the best product possible
- Create a repeatable growth engine
- Operate the business with clarity and speed
- Keep accountability visible across lanes

## Principles

- One business, multiple lanes
- Clear handoffs between lanes
- Metrics drive priorities, not opinions
- Escalation is defined before it is needed

## Quick Map

- `lanes/` -> Each business function with owner, outputs, KPIs
- `metrics.md` -> North star + leading indicators
- `cadence.md` -> Weekly/quarterly operating rhythm
- `escalation-matrix.md` -> What escalates, to whom, and when
- `agent-roster.md` -> Role agents and delegation rules
- `coordination.md` -> Cross-lane handoffs and decision flow

## Relationship to Product Work

Product/engineering builds the system. The other lanes drive priorities, inputs,
and validation. If a lane cannot move, it becomes a product requirement.

## How to Use

- Review `metrics.md` weekly
- Update lane docs when responsibilities or KPIs change
- Use `coordination.md` for cross-lane requests
- Add decisions to `docs/05-decisions/` when long-lived
