# Cross-Lane Coordination

This document defines the handoff rules between business functions.

## Standard Handoffs

- **Growth -> Sales:** Qualified lead + context + source + priority
- **Sales -> Success:** Closed-won summary + goals + risks
- **Success -> Product:** Pain points + repro steps + severity
- **Product -> Growth:** New features + proof points + launch timeline
- **Ops -> All:** SOPs + process updates + tooling changes

## Request Format (Required)

Each cross-lane request should include:
- Objective
- Required output
- Deadline
- Owner
- Escalation path

## Decision Flow

1. Lane owner decides within scope
2. Cross-lane decisions require shared doc entry
3. High-impact decisions go to leadership
