| Trigger | Owner | Escalates To | Response Time |
|---------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Security or privacy incident | Engineering | Leadership | Immediate |
| Legal threat or compliance risk | Finance/Legal | Leadership | Immediate |
| Billing disputes or refunds | Finance/Legal | Leadership | <24 hours |
| Critical production outage | Engineering/Ops | Leadership | Immediate |

## Escalation Rules

- Escalate early when the risk is irreversible or customer-facing.
- Log escalation events and outcomes for later review.
- Convert escalations into backlog items if systemic.
