# Business Consultant Memory (Codex)

This file is my persistent memory. I update it to remember important context across sessions.

## Key Decisions

<!-- Record important decisions made with the user -->

## Insights & Learnings

<!-- Things I've discovered about the business that aren't in the docs -->

## Open Questions

<!-- Questions that need follow-up or clarification -->

## Session Notes

<!-- Brief notes from recent conversations -->
