Fix the Exports serialization and strip `filepath` before passing data to the client.  \n2.

Fix the Exports serialization and strip `filepath` before passing data to the client.  \n2. Refactor Supabase queries to compute counts/aggregates server-side and fix the “needs attention” filters + recent activity sorting.  \n3.

AI handles the writing—the contractor's work is the hero.\n\n### Voice Checklist\n- [ ] Does it focus on the contractor's work, not our technology?\n- [ ] Does it promise outcomes (more jobs) not features (fast/easy)?\n- [ ] Would a busy contractor understand it in 3 seconds?\n- [ ] Does it avoid jargon like \"case study\", \"SEO\", \"AI-powered\"?\n\n### Quick Reference\n- **Hero**: The contractor and their craftsmanship\n- **Villain**: Competitors with better online presence stealing jobs\n- **Solution**: Make every project visible proof that builds trust\n- **Tone**: Direct, practical, tradesperson-friendly\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills.

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/knearme-portfolio/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/knearme-portfolio</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"plese do a complete code reveiw of /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/review-agent-dashboard look for potneint perfomacen isseu - ui isses - ux issues - code quality issues. bugs"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"The dashboard is actually intended to be mobile first.

AI handles the writing—the contractor's work is the hero.\n\n### Voice Checklist\n- [ ] Does it focus on the contractor's work, not our technology?\n- [ ] Does it promise outcomes (more jobs) not features (fast/easy)?\n- [ ] Would a busy contractor understand it in 3 seconds?\n- [ ] Does it avoid jargon like \"case study\", \"SEO\", \"AI-powered\"?\n\n### Quick Reference\n- **Hero**: The contractor and their craftsmanship\n- **Villain**: Competitors with better online presence stealing jobs\n- **Solution**: Make every project visible proof that builds trust\n- **Tone**: Direct, practical, tradesperson-friendly\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/knearme-portfolio/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/knearme-portfolio/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/knearme-portfolio</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>on-request</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"plese do a complete code reveiw of /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/review-agent-dashboard look for potneint perfomacen isseu - ui isses - ux issues - code quality issues. bugs"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"The dashboard is actually intended to be mobile first.
