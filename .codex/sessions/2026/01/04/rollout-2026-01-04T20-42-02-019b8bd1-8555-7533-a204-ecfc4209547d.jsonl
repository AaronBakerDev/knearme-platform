Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Treat the reader as a complete beginner to this repository: they have only the current working tree and the single ExecPlan file you provide. There is no memory of prior plans and no external context.\n\n## How to use ExecPlans and PLANS.md\n\nWhen authoring an executable specification (ExecPlan), follow PLANS.md to the letter. If it is not in your context, refresh your memory by reading the entire PLANS.md file. Be thorough in reading (and re-reading) source material to produce an accurate specification. When creating a spec, start from the skeleton and flesh it out as you do your research.\n\nWhen implementing an executable specification (ExecPlan), do not prompt the user for \"next steps\"; simply proceed to the next milestone. Keep all sections up to date, add or split entries in the list at every stopping point to affirmatively state the progress made and next steps. Resolve ambiguities autonomously, and commit frequently.\n\nWhen discussing an executable specification (ExecPlan), record decisions in a log in the spec for posterity; it should be unambiguously clear why any change to the specification was made. ExecPlans are living documents, and it should always be possible to restart from only the ExecPlan and no other work.\n\nWhen researching a design with challenging requirements or significant unknowns, use milestones to implement proof of concepts, \"toy implementations\", etc., that allow validating whether the user's proposal is feasible. Read the source code of libraries by finding or acquiring them, research deeply, and include prototypes to guide a fuller implementation.\n\n## Requirements\n\nNON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Every ExecPlan must be fully self-contained. Self-contained means that in its current form it contains all knowledge and instructions needed for a novice to succeed.\n* Every ExecPlan is a living document. Contributors are required to revise it as progress is made, as discoveries occur, and as design decisions are finalized. Each revision must remain fully self-contained.\n* Every ExecPlan must enable a complete novice to implement the feature end-to-end without prior knowledge of this repo.\n* Every ExecPlan must produce a demonstrably working behavior, not merely code changes to \"meet a definition\".\n* Every ExecPlan must define every term of art in plain language or do not use it.\n\nPurpose and intent come first. Begin by explaining, in a few sentences, why the work matters from a user's perspective: what someone can do after this change that they could not do before, and how to see it working. Then guide the reader through the exact steps to achieve that outcome, including what to edit, what to run, and what they should observe.\n\nThe agent executing your plan can list files, read files, search, run the project, and run tests. It does not know any prior context and cannot infer what you meant from earlier milestones. Repeat any assumption you rely on. Do not point to external blogs or docs; if knowledge is required, embed it in the plan itself in your own words. If an ExecPlan builds upon a prior ExecPlan and that file is checked in, incorporate it by reference. If it is not, you must include all relevant context from that plan.\n\n## Formatting\n\nFormat and envelope are simple and strict. Each ExecPlan must be one single fenced code block labeled as `md` that begins and ends with triple backticks. Do not nest additional triple-backtick code fences inside; when you need to show commands, transcripts, diffs, or code, present them as indented blocks within that single fence. Use indentation for clarity rather than code fences inside an ExecPlan to avoid prematurely closing the ExecPlan's code fence. Use two newlines after every heading, use # and ## and so on, and correct syntax for ordered and unordered lists.\n\nWhen writing an ExecPlan to a Markdown (.md) file where the content of the file is only the single ExecPlan, you should omit the triple backticks.\n\nWrite in plain prose. Prefer sentences over lists. Avoid checklists, tables, and long enumerations unless brevity would obscure meaning. Checklists are permitted only in the `Progress` section, where they are mandatory. Narrative sections must remain prose-first.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nSelf-containment and plain language are paramount. If you introduce a phrase that is not ordinary English (\"daemon\", \"middleware\", \"RPC gateway\", \"filter graph\"), define it immediately and remind the reader how it manifests in this repository (for example, by naming the files or commands where it appears). Do not say \"as defined previously\" or \"according to the architecture doc.\" Include the needed explanation here, even if you repeat yourself.\n\nAvoid common failure modes. Do not rely on undefined jargon. Do not describe \"the letter of a feature\" so narrowly that the resulting code compiles but does nothing meaningful. Do not outsource key decisions to the reader. When ambiguity exists, resolve it in the plan itself and explain why you chose that path. Err on the side of over-explaining user-visible effects and under-specifying incidental implementation details.\n\nAnchor the plan with observable outcomes. State what the user can do after implementation, the commands to run, and the outputs they should see. Acceptance should be phrased as behavior a human can verify (\"after starting the server, navigating to http://localhost:8080/health returns HTTP 200 with body OK\") rather than internal attributes (\"added a HealthCheck struct\"). If a change is internal, explain how its impact can still be demonstrated (for example, by running tests that fail before and pass after, and by showing a scenario that uses the new behavior).\n\nSpecify repository context explicitly. Name files with full repository-relative paths, name functions and modules precisely, and describe where new files should be created. If touching multiple areas, include a short orientation paragraph that explains how those parts fit together so a novice can navigate confidently. When running commands, show the working directory and exact command line. When outcomes depend on environment, state the assumptions and provide alternatives when reasonable.\n\nBe idempotent and safe. Write the steps so they can be run multiple times without causing damage or drift. If a step can fail halfway, include how to retry or adapt. If a migration or destructive operation is necessary, spell out backups or safe fallbacks. Prefer additive, testable changes that can be validated as you go.\n\nValidation is not optional. Include instructions to run tests, to start the system if applicable, and to observe it doing something useful. Describe comprehensive testing for any new features or capabilities. Include expected outputs and error messages so a novice can tell success from failure. Where possible, show how to prove that the change is effective beyond compilation (for example, through a small end-to-end scenario, a CLI invocation, or an HTTP request/response transcript). State the exact test commands appropriate to the project's toolchain and how to interpret their results.\n\nCapture evidence. When your steps produce terminal output, short diffs, or logs, include them inside the single fenced block as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success. If you need to include a patch, prefer file-scoped diffs or small excerpts that a reader can recreate by following your instructions rather than pasting large blobs.\n\n## Milestones\n\nMilestones are narrative, not bureaucracy. If you break the work into milestones, introduce each with a brief paragraph that describes the scope, what will exist at the end of the milestone that did not exist before, the commands to run, and the acceptance you expect to observe. Keep it readable as a story: goal, work, result, proof. Progress and milestones are distinct: milestones tell the story, progress tracks granular work. Both must exist. Never abbreviate a milestone merely for the sake of brevity, do not leave out details that could be crucial to a future implementation.\n\nEach milestone must be independently verifiable and incrementally implement the overall goal of the execution plan.\n\n## Living plans and design decisions\n\n* ExecPlans are living documents. As you make key design decisions, update the plan to record both the decision and the thinking behind it. Record all decisions in the `Decision Log` section.\n* ExecPlans must contain and maintain a `Progress` section, a `Surprises & Discoveries` section, a `Decision Log`, and an `Outcomes & Retrospective` section. These are not optional.\n* When you discover optimizer behavior, performance tradeoffs, unexpected bugs, or inverse/unapply semantics that shaped your approach, capture those observations in the `Surprises & Discoveries` section with short evidence snippets (test output is ideal).\n* If you change course mid-implementation, document why in the `Decision Log` and reflect the implications in `Progress`. Plans are guides for the next contributor as much as checklists for you.\n* At completion of a major task or the full plan, write an `Outcomes & Retrospective` entry summarizing what was achieved, what remains, and lessons learned.\n\n# Prototyping milestones and parallel implementations\n\nIt is acceptable -- and often encouraged -- to include explicit prototyping milestones when they de-risk a larger change. Examples: adding a low-level operator to a dependency to validate feasibility, or exploring two composition orders while measuring optimizer effects. Keep prototypes additive and testable. Clearly label the scope as \"prototyping\"; describe how to run and observe results; and state the criteria for promoting or discarding the prototype.\n\nPrefer additive code changes followed by subtractions that keep tests passing. Parallel implementations (e.g., keeping an adapter alongside an older path during migration) are fine when they reduce risk or enable tests to continue passing during a large migration. Describe how to validate both paths and how to retire one safely with tests. When working with multiple new libraries or feature areas, consider creating spikes that evaluate the feasibility of these features independently of one another, proving that the external library performs as expected and implements the features we need in isolation.\n\n## Skeleton of a Good ExecPlan\n\n```md\n# <Short, action-oriented description>\n\nThis ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nIf PLANS.md file is checked into the repo, reference the path to that file here from the repository root and note that this document must be maintained in accordance with PLANS.md.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nExplain in a few sentences what someone gains after this change and how they can see it working. State the user-visible behavior you will enable.\n\n## Progress\n\nUse a list with checkboxes to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here, even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two (\"done\" vs. \"remaining\"). This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.\n\n- [x] (2025-10-01 13:00Z) Example completed step.\n- [ ] Example incomplete step.\n- [ ] Example partially completed step (completed: X; remaining: Y).\n\nUse timestamps to measure rates of progress.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\nDocument unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during implementation. Provide concise evidence.\n\n- Observation: ...\n  Evidence: ...\n\n## Decision Log\n\nRecord every decision made while working on the plan in the format:\n\n- Decision: ...\n  Rationale: ...\n  Date/Author: ...\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\nSummarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned at major milestones or at completion. Compare the result against the original purpose.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nDescribe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name the key files and modules by full path. Define any non-obvious term you will use. Do not refer to prior plans.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nDescribe, in prose, the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location (function, module) and what to insert or change. Keep it concrete and minimal.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\nState the exact commands to run and where to run them (working directory). When a command generates output, show a short expected transcript so the reader can compare. This section must be updated as work proceeds.\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nDescribe how to start or exercise the system and what to observe. Phrase acceptance as behavior, with specific inputs and outputs. If tests are involved, say \"run <project's test command> and expect <N> passed; the new test <name> fails before the change and passes after\".\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nIf steps can be repeated safely, say so. If a step is risky, provide a safe retry or rollback path. Keep the environment clean after completion.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nInclude the most important transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success.\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nBe prescriptive. Name the libraries, modules, and services to use and why. Specify the types, traits/interfaces, and function signatures that must exist at the end of the milestone. Prefer stable names and paths such as `crate::module::function` or `package.submodule.Interface`. E.g.:\n\nIn crates/foo/planner.rs, define:\n\n    pub trait Planner {\n        fn plan(&self, observed: &Observed) -> Vec<Action>;\n    }\n```\n\nIf you follow the guidance above, a single, stateless agent -- or a human novice -- can read your ExecPlan from top to bottom and produce a working, observable result. That is the bar: SELF-CONTAINED, SELF-SUFFICIENT, NOVICE-GUIDING, OUTCOME-FOCUSED.\n\nWhen you revise a plan, you must ensure your changes are comprehensively reflected across all sections, including the living document sections, and you must write a note at the bottom of the plan describing the change and the reason why. ExecPlans must describe not just the what but the why for almost everything.\n"}}

Supabase Client Initialization\n\n**Server-side (Server Components, API routes):**\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'\nconst supabase = await createClient()  // async\n```\n\n**Client-side (Client Components):**\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'\nconst supabase = createClient()  // sync\n```\n\n**Admin operations (bypasses RLS):**\n```typescript\nimport { createAdminClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'\nconst supabase = createAdminClient()  // use sparingly\n```\n\n### 2. File Upload Pattern (All Supabase Projects)\n\nStandard two-step upload flow:\n1. Client requests signed upload URL: `POST /api/objects/upload`\n2. Client uploads file directly to Supabase Storage using signed URL\n3. Client saves returned file path to database\n4. Files served via: `GET /objects/:objectPath`\n\n**Always normalize paths** using `normalizeObjectEntityPath()` before storing in database.\n\n### 3. Database Migration Pattern\n\n**Drizzle ORM projects** (directory-platforms/supabase):\n```bash\n# 1. Update schema in shared/schema.ts\n# 2. Push changes to database\nnpm run db:push\n```\n\n**Supabase projects** (knearme-portfolio):\n```sql\n-- Create migration in supabase/migrations/XXX_migration_name.sql\n-- Apply via Supabase dashboard or CLI\n```\n\n### 4. Route Group Pattern (Next.js Projects)\n\nNext.js projects use route groups to separate concerns:\n```\napp/\n├── (auth)/         # Unauthenticated flows (login, signup)\n├── (contractor)/   # Authenticated dashboard\n├── (public)/       # Public SEO pages (Server Components)\n└── api/           # API routes\n```\n\n**Key Rule:** Public routes should use Server Components for SEO optimization.\n\n## Documentation Map\n\n### Product Documentation\n- **`COMPARISON.md`**: Comprehensive comparison of all directory and rank-tracking platforms\n- **`docs/PRODUCT-SPECIFICATION.md`**: Product requirements and specifications\n- **`docs/AI-POWERED-PORTFOLIO-CONCEPT.md`**: Vision for AI portfolio generator\n\n### Project-Specific Docs\nEach major project has its own CLAUDE.md with detailed guidance:\n- **`knearme-portfolio/CLAUDE.md`**: AI portfolio platform (most detailed)\n- **`directory-platforms/supabase/CLAUDE.md`**: Directory platform architecture\n- **`directory-platforms/astro-main/CLAUDE.md`**: Astro SEO implementation\n\n### Additional Resources\n- **`docs/business/`**: Business models, pricing strategy, competitive analysis\n- **`docs/content-planning/`**: Content strategy and planning\n- **`docs/agents/`**: Agent configurations and automation\n\n## Important Cross-Project Notes\n\n### Supabase Project Configuration\n\n**Active Supabase Projects:**\n1. **chimney_repair** (directory-platforms/supabase)\n   - Project Ref: `xynhhmliqdvyzrqnlvmk`\n   - Database: `db.xynhhmliqdvyzrqnlvmk.supabase.co`\n   - See: `directory-platforms/supabase/CLAUDE.md` for MCP configuration\n\n2. **knearme-portfolio** (project ref not documented yet)\n   - Check `.env.local` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to identify project\n\n### Migration History\n\n**directory-platforms/supabase** was recently migrated (Nov 2025):\n- ❌ Replit OIDC → ✅ Supabase Auth\n- ❌ Google Cloud Storage → ✅ Supabase Storage\n- ❌ Neon WebSocket → ✅ Standard PostgreSQL driver\n\n**Backup files:** `server/*.bak` contain old implementations (reference only).\n\n### Technology Stack Summary\n\n| Project | Framework | Database | Auth | Deployment |\n|---------|-----------|----------|------|------------|\n| knearme-portfolio | Next.js 14 | Supabase PostgreSQL | Supabase Auth | Vercel |\n| directory-platforms/supabase | React + Express | Supabase PostgreSQL | Supabase Auth | Vercel |\n| directory-platforms/astro-main | Astro 4 | Cloudflare D1 | Cloudflare Access | Cloudflare Pages |\n| directory-platforms/mvp | Vite + React | Supabase | Supabase Auth | Vercel |\n| rank-tracking/local-beacon | Vite + React | Supabase + PostGIS | Supabase Auth | Vercel |\n| rank-tracking/next-tracker | Next.js 14 | Supabase | Supabase Auth | Vercel |\n\n## Common Workflows\n\n### Starting Work on a Project\n\n1. **Identify the correct project** from structure above\n2. **Read project-specific CLAUDE.md** for detailed guidance\n3. **Review COMPARISON.md** to understand project maturity and status\n4. **Install dependencies** if not already installed: `npm install`\n5. **Check environment variables** - copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`\n6. **Start development server** using project-specific command\n\n### Adding Features Across Multiple Projects\n\nWhen implementing a feature that should exist in multiple projects:\n1. **Implement in primary project first** (e.g., knearme-portfolio or supabase)\n2. **Document the implementation pattern** in this file or project CLAUDE.md\n3. **Extract reusable code** where possible\n4. **Port to other projects** following established patterns\n\n### Extracting SEO Features from astro-main\n\nTo add SEO features from astro-main to other projects:\n1. **Reference files:**\n   - `directory-platforms/astro-main/src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts`\n   - `directory-platforms/astro-main/public/robots.txt`\n   - `directory-platforms/astro-main/src/layouts/*.astro` (structured data)\n2. **Adapt to target project's framework** (Next.js vs React)\n3. **Update routes** to match target project's URL structure\n\n### Working with Multiple Supabase Projects\n\nWhen working across projects with different Supabase instances:\n1. **Check project-specific CLAUDE.md** for project ref and configuration\n2. **Use project-scoped environment variables** (never mix .env files)\n3. **Configure MCP per-project** if using Supabase MCP server\n\n## Repository Consolidation Notes\n\nPer `COMPARISON.md` recommendations:\n\n**Primary Projects (Keep Active):**\n- ✅ `knearme-portfolio/` - Active development\n- ✅ `directory-platforms/supabase/` - Production-ready directory\n- ✅ `rank-tracking/local-beacon/` - Most complete tracker\n\n**Reference Projects (Use for Feature Extraction):**\n- 📚 `directory-platforms/astro-main/` - SEO patterns, testing\n- 📚 `rank-tracking/next-tracker/` - Resource center, subscription patterns\n\n**Archive Candidates (After Feature Migration):**\n- 📦 `directory-platforms/mvp/` - Prototype (over-engineered)\n- 📦 `directory-platforms/v4/` - Clean code reference (needs auth migration)\n\n**Disk Space:** ~5.3 GB total; potential 2-4 GB savings after consolidation.\n\n## Getting Help\n\n### Framework Documentation\n- **Next.js**: https://nextjs.org/docs\n- **Astro**: https://docs.astro.build\n- **React**: https://react.dev\n\n### Service Documentation\n- **Supabase**: https://supabase.com/docs\n- **Cloudflare Pages**: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages\n- **Vercel**: https://vercel.com/docs\n\n### UI/Component Libraries\n- **shadcn/ui**: https://ui.shadcn.com\n- **Radix UI**: https://www.radix-ui.com\n- **Tailwind CSS**: https://tailwindcss.com/docs\n\n### Project-Specific Help\nAlways check the project's own CLAUDE.md file first for detailed implementation guidance.\n"}}

{"timestamp":"2026-01-05T01:47:58.332Z","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"function_call","name":"shell_command","arguments":"{\"command\":\"cat <<'EOF' > agent-docs-execplan.md\\n# Initialize .agent documentation snapshot for KnearMe workspace\\n\\nThis ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\\n\\nThis plan must be maintained in accordance with `PLANS.md` at the repository root.\\n\\n## Purpose / Big Picture\\n\\nThe goal is to give future agents a compact, reliable memory of this workspace without re-reading the entire codebase. After this work, a new `.agent` documentation directory exists at the repository root with an architecture snapshot, an index that tells agents what to read, and SOP guidance on keeping the docs fresh. The behavior is observable by opening `.agent/README.md` and seeing links to architecture and SOP files, and by seeing the new Documentation Rules section in `CLAUDE.md`.\\n\\n## Progress\\n\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:47Z) Scan the workspace to capture the tech stack, directory structure, core components, database sources, and integrations needed for the architecture summary.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:47Z) Create `.agent` with `System`, `Tasks`, and `SOP` subfolders and author the initial documentation files, including the architecture snapshot, index, and documentation standards.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:47Z) Update the root `CLAUDE.md` with the Documentation Rules section that points agents to `.agent/README.md` and describes maintenance expectations.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:47Z) Add `commands/update-doc.md` to standardize future documentation refresh workflows.\\n\\n## Surprises & Discoveries\\n\\n- Observation: None yet; no unexpected constraints observed before implementation.\\n  Evidence: Not applicable.\\n\\n## Decision Log\\n\\n- Decision: Scope the documentation snapshot to the workspace root and summarize each top-level project rather than selecting a single app.\\n  Rationale: The request explicitly targets the current codebase at the root, which is a multi-project workspace, and the documentation should guide agents to the correct subproject quickly.\\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 01:47Z / Codex\\n\\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\\n\\nPending until implementation completes.\\n\\n## Context and Orientation\\n\\nThe repository root contains multiple independent applications and tooling directories such as `directory-platforms`, `rank-tracking`, `knearme-portfolio`, `business-agent`, and `review-agent-dashboard`. There is no `.agent` directory yet. The architecture snapshot must be derived from project-level configuration files such as each top-level `package.json`, schema files like `directory-platforms/v4/shared/schema.ts`, and database migrations like `knearme-portfolio/supabase/migrations/20260103055338_remote_schema.sql`. The root `CLAUDE.md` provides cross-project context and must be updated with documentation rules.\\n\\n## Plan of Work\\n\\nStart by scanning the workspace to identify the tech stack, major frameworks, data sources, and integrations for each top-level project. Use that information to draft `.agent/System/project_architecture.md` with concise sections for stack, structure, data flow patterns, database schema summaries, and integrations. Create `.agent/README.md` as the entry point with a one-sentence overview, links to the other `.agent` files, and guidance on when to read each file. Add `.agent/SOP/documentation_standards.md` and a starter `.agent/SOP/mistakes_log.md` to capture how to keep documentation current. Finally, update the root `CLAUDE.md` to include Documentation Rules and add `commands/update-doc.md` with the standardized update prompt.\\n\\n## Concrete Steps\\n\\nRun the following commands from the repository root to collect context and verify results:\\n\\n  ls -a\\n  rg --files -g 'package.json' -g '!**/node_modules/**'\\n  rg -n \\\"CREATE TABLE\\\" knearme-portfolio/supabase/migrations/20260103055338_remote_schema.sql\\n  sed -n '1,200p' directory-platforms/v4/shared/schema.ts\\n  sed -n '1,200p' directory-platforms/supabase/shared/schema.ts\\n\\nCreate the documentation structure and files:\\n\\n  mkdir -p .agent/System .agent/Tasks .agent/SOP\\n  cat > .agent/System/project_architecture.md\\n  cat > .agent/README.md\\n  cat > .agent/SOP/documentation_standards.md\\n  cat > .agent/SOP/mistakes_log.md\\n\\nUpdate the root documentation rules and add the update command:\\n\\n  $EDITOR CLAUDE.md\\n  mkdir -p commands\\n  cat > commands/update-doc.md\\n\\nConfirm the new structure:\\n\\n  ls -a .agent\\n  rg -n \\\"Documentation Rules\\\" CLAUDE.md\\n\\n## Validation and Acceptance\\n\\nThe change is accepted when `.agent/README.md` exists, links to the architecture and SOP files, and includes guidance on when to read them. `.agent/System/project_architecture.md` must summarize the workspace tech stack, structure, data flow patterns, database schema sources, and integrations, and `.agent/SOP/documentation_standards.md` must include the three required statements. The root `CLAUDE.md` must contain a `# Documentation Rules` section with the three required lines, and `commands/update-doc.md` must contain the prescribed update prompt. A quick `ls -a .agent` should show `System`, `Tasks`, and `SOP` subdirectories.\\n\\n## Idempotence and Recovery\\n\\nThese steps are safe to rerun because the directories can be created with `mkdir -p` and the documentation files can be overwritten intentionally with updated content. If a file is written incorrectly, delete and re-create just that file without affecting other parts of the workspace.\\n\\n## Artifacts and Notes\\n\\nA successful run should produce a structure similar to this:\\n\\n  .agent/\\n    README.md\\n    System/\\n      project_architecture.md\\n    SOP/\\n      documentation_standards.md\\n      mistakes_log.md\\n    Tasks/\\n\\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\\n\\nThis change introduces no runtime interfaces, but it does introduce documentation artifacts that future agents must follow. The required files are `.agent/System/project_architecture.md`, `.agent/README.md`, `.agent/SOP/documentation_standards.md`, `.agent/SOP/mistakes_log.md`, and `commands/update-doc.md`. The documentation should reference the relevant project files, such as `knearme-portfolio/package.json` and `directory-platforms/v4/shared/schema.ts`, but no code interfaces are added or modified.\\n\\n## Revision Notes\\n\\nInitial plan created to capture the documentation bootstrap requirements for the workspace.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace\"}","call_id":"call_jj7CshCWnnmB5zO15nHO18oG"}}

The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\\n\\nThis plan must be maintained in accordance with `PLANS.md` at the repository root.\\n\\n## Purpose / Big Picture\\n\\nThe goal is to preserve knowledge from predecessor apps and the ad hoc agents that still share the Supabase database so we can refactor or decommission safely. After this work, the workspace will contain a shared database contract document, a legacy systems inventory that explains how each app uses the DB and what must be preserved, and a phased decommission strategy that avoids breaking active workflows. This is observable by opening the new `.agent/System` docs and seeing a clear mapping of tables to applications, plus a phased plan that names what stays, what is archived, and how to verify nothing breaks.\\n\\n## Progress\\n\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:50Z) Inventory all apps that touch the shared Supabase database and record their data access patterns.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:50Z) Create shared database contract documentation and legacy system inventory in `.agent/System`.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:50Z) Define and document a phased decommission strategy with validation steps.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 01:50Z) Update `.agent/README.md` to index the new documentation artifacts.\\n\\n## Surprises & Discoveries\\n\\n- Observation: None yet; initial plan is based on stated usage of shared Supabase DB across apps and agents.\\n  Evidence: Not applicable.\\n\\n## Decision Log\\n\\n- Decision: Treat `knearme-portfolio/` as the canonical application while documenting all other apps and agents as legacy-but-active dependencies.\\n  Rationale: The user stated that the portfolio app is the primary app going forward while other systems are still in use and share the database.\\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 01:50Z / Codex\\n\\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\\n\\nPending until implementation completes.\\n\\n## Context and Orientation\\n\\nThis workspace is a multi-project repository. The canonical application going forward is `knearme-portfolio/`, but several other apps and agents still run and share the same Supabase database, including `review-agent-dashboard/`, `contractor-review-agent/`, `business-agent/`, and `business-agent-codex/`. The predecessor apps under `directory-platforms/` and `rank-tracking/` were used to build toward the portfolio app but may still contain logic or schema assumptions. A “legacy system” in this plan means any app or agent that is not the canonical portfolio app but still reads or writes shared data. “Decommission” means intentionally reducing usage over time, moving remaining responsibilities to the canonical app, and eventually archiving or removing the legacy code with evidence that nothing breaks. A “shared DB contract” means a concise mapping of database tables and critical data flows to the applications that own or depend on them.\\n\\n## Plan of Work\\n\\nBegin by building an inventory of every application or agent that connects to Supabase or other databases. Use repository searches and local configuration files to identify Supabase clients, environment variables, SQL migrations, and typed database definitions. Record findings in a new `.agent/System/legacy_systems_inventory.md` file that lists each system, what it does, how it connects to data, and whether it is active.\\n\\nNext, document the shared database contract in `.agent/System/shared_db_contract.md`. Summarize the shared schema sources, list the high-risk tables that multiple apps touch, and identify the presumed owner for each critical area such as portfolios, reviews, and rank-tracking data. Include a short description of invariants that must remain true during refactors, such as required columns or status enums.\\n\\nFinally, author a phased decommission strategy in `.agent/System/decommission_strategy.md`. The strategy should define three phases: documentation and dependency mapping, migration of responsibilities to `knearme-portfolio/`, and archive or removal of unused systems. Each phase must include observable checks, such as a list of functions or scripts that must still run, and how to verify them without production impact.\\n\\nWhen the documents are created, update `.agent/README.md` to link to the new files and include guidance on when to read them.\\n\\n## Concrete Steps\\n\\nRun the following commands from the repository root to locate data access points and usage patterns:\\n\\n    rg -n \\\"supabase\\\" -g '!**/node_modules/**'\\n    rg -n \\\"SUPABASE|supabase\\\" -g '*.env*' -g '!**/node_modules/**'\\n    rg -n \\\"createClient|createAdminClient\\\" -g '!**/node_modules/**'\\n    rg -n \\\"drizzle|schema\\\" directory-platforms -g '!**/node_modules/**'\\n    rg -n \\\"Database\\\" rank-tracking/next-tracker/src/types/supabase.ts\\n    rg -n \\\"Contractor|Project|Lead\\\" rank-tracking/local-beacon/packages/database/src\\n\\nCreate the documentation files:\\n\\n    cat > .agent/System/legacy_systems_inventory.md\\n    cat > .agent/System/shared_db_contract.md\\n    cat > .agent/System/decommission_strategy.md\\n\\nUpdate the index:\\n\\n    $EDITOR .agent/README.md\\n\\nExpected outputs should confirm that the new files exist and are linked:\\n\\n    ls .agent/System\\n\\n        legacy_systems_inventory.md\\n        shared_db_contract.md\\n        decommission_strategy.md\\n\\n## Validation and Acceptance\\n\\nThe change is accepted when the new system documentation exists and is indexed in `.agent/README.md`. The legacy systems inventory must name each active app or agent, how it connects to the database, and whether it is a candidate for phase-out. The shared DB contract must map high-risk tables to owning systems and state invariants that refactors must preserve. The decommission strategy must define phases with specific verification checks and clearly state that `knearme-portfolio/` remains the canonical app.\\n\\n## Idempotence and Recovery\\n\\nThese steps are safe to rerun because they only add or update documentation.

Limit new writes to the canonical app when possible.\n- .env files in several apps point to the same Supabase project; do not rotate or delete keys without coordinating across all active systems.\n- If new schema changes are required, update the canonical migration in knearme-portfolio and then validate downstream types (next-tracker and local-beacon) for compatibility.\n"}}

The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\\n\\nThis plan must be maintained in accordance with `PLANS.md` at the repository root.\\n\\n## Purpose / Big Picture\\n\\nThe goal is to stop new writes from the legacy case study pipeline in `directory-platforms/mvp` while keeping existing case study data readable and avoiding breakage in the canonical portfolio app. After this change, the legacy UI will behave in a read-only mode with a clear deprecation message, Supabase Edge Functions will refuse new writes with a consistent disabled response, and operators can verify that no new rows are created in case study tables. This is observable by trying to create or edit a case study in the MVP app and seeing a decommission notice without any new database writes, and by invoking the Edge Functions and receiving a disabled response.\\n\\n## Progress\\n\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 02:23Z) Add a case study pipeline feature flag to the MVP client and wire it into the case study UI to prevent new writes.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 02:23Z) Add server-side guards to Supabase Edge Functions to refuse new case study writes when the pipeline is disabled.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 02:23Z) Update documentation and environment guidance to reflect the decommission state and how to re-enable if needed.\\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 02:23Z) Validate that no new rows are written to case study tables and that the MVP UI is read-only.\\n\\n## Surprises & Discoveries\\n\\n- Observation: The canonical migration shows `chat_messages` keyed by `session_id`, while the MVP code writes `case_study_id`, so schema validation must be confirmed in the live database before relying on table-level checks.\\n  Evidence: `knearme-portfolio/supabase/migrations/20260103055338_remote_schema.sql` defines `chat_messages.session_id`, while `directory-platforms/mvp/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` writes `case_study_id`.\\n\\n## Decision Log\\n\\n- Decision: Implement a kill switch via environment variables in both the MVP client and the Edge Functions, and treat the pipeline as disabled unless explicitly enabled.\\n  Rationale: The pipeline is being decommissioned, so a default-disabled behavior prevents accidental writes while keeping re-enable capability for rollback or audits.\\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 02:23Z / Codex\\n\\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\\n\\nPending until implementation completes.\\n\\n## Context and Orientation\\n\\nThe legacy case study pipeline lives in `directory-platforms/mvp`. The client UI writes to tables `case_studies`, `case_study_details`, `case_study_images`, `chat_messages`, and `agent_handoff_log` via `directory-platforms/mvp/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`, and calls Supabase Edge Functions in `directory-platforms/mvp/supabase/functions` named `process-case-study`, `analyze-images`, and `generate-draft`. An Edge Function is a serverless HTTP handler hosted by Supabase that can write to the database; a kill switch is a configuration flag that prevents those handlers from mutating data. The canonical app is `knearme-portfolio`, so this plan only disables new writes from the MVP pipeline and does not delete data or tables.\\n\\n## Plan of Work\\n\\nFirst, add a client-side feature flag in the MVP app to ensure no new writes occur from the UI. Centralize the flag in a small helper module and use it in `Dashboard.tsx`, `useCaseStudyChat.tsx`, `ImageUploader.tsx`, and `ChatInterface.tsx` to disable create, send, upload, and delete actions while still allowing read-only views. The UI should show a clear message that the case study workflow is deprecated.\\n\\nNext, add a server-side guard to each Supabase Edge Function so they return a disabled response before parsing or writing data when the kill switch is off. This ensures any direct invocation of the functions is blocked even if the UI is bypassed.\\n\\nFinally, update the documentation and environment guidance in `.agent/System` and the MVP README so operators know how to control the flag. Validate by running the MVP app locally and by checking Supabase tables for new rows after simulated use.\\n\\n## Concrete Steps\\n\\nFrom the repository root, move into the MVP project and check for local agent rules before editing:\\n\\n    cd directory-platforms/mvp\\n    ls AGENTS.md\\n\\nIf `AGENTS.md` exists, read and follow its instructions before continuing.\\n\\nCreate a client-side feature flag helper at `directory-platforms/mvp/src/lib/caseStudyPipeline.ts` that exports a boolean such as `caseStudyPipelineEnabled`. Use `import.meta.env.VITE_CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED === \\\"true\\\"` and default to false when the variable is missing. Update `directory-platforms/mvp/README.md` to document the new `VITE_CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED` flag and its effect.\\n\\nUpdate `directory-platforms/mvp/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` to disable `createNewCaseStudy` when the pipeline is disabled, and show a visible deprecation notice near the header. Ensure the New Case Study button is disabled and does not call `db.caseStudies.insert` when the flag is off.\\n\\nUpdate `directory-platforms/mvp/src/hooks/useCaseStudyChat.tsx` to skip `initializeChat` and short-circuit `handleSendMessage` when disabled, returning a toast or inline warning instead of inserting chat messages or invoking `process-case-study`.\\n\\nUpdate `directory-platforms/mvp/src/components/case-study/ChatInterface.tsx` to accept a `disabled` prop, disable the textarea and submit button, and display a short message indicating the workflow is deprecated and read-only. Wire this new prop through `ChatContainer.tsx` and `CaseStudyEditor.tsx`.\\n\\nUpdate `directory-platforms/mvp/src/components/case-study/ImageUploader.tsx` to disable upload and delete actions when the pipeline is disabled. This should prevent writes to `case_study_images`, `case_studies`, and the `case-study-images` storage bucket while still allowing image previews for existing records.\\n\\nAdd a kill switch in each Edge Function at `directory-platforms/mvp/supabase/functions/process-case-study/index.ts`, `directory-platforms/mvp/supabase/functions/analyze-images/index.ts`, and `directory-platforms/mvp/supabase/functions/generate-draft/index.ts`. After handling CORS OPTIONS, check `Deno.env.get(\\\"CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED\\\") === \\\"true\\\"`; if not enabled, return a JSON response with a 410 status and a message like `{\\\"error\\\":\\\"case study pipeline disabled\\\"}` without performing any database writes. Record the environment variable in the function documentation or README so operators know where to set it.\\n\\nUpdate `.agent/System/shared_db_contract.md` and `.agent/System/legacy_systems_inventory.md` to note that the pipeline is now disabled by default and the kill switch is live. Add a short entry to `.agent/System/phase1_case_study_decommission_checklist.md` marking the code-level guardrails as complete.\\n\\n## Validation and Acceptance\\n\\nRun the MVP app and confirm that creating a new case study is blocked, chat input is disabled, and image uploads or deletions are prevented with a clear deprecation notice. Invoke the Supabase Edge Functions with test requests and confirm they return a 410 response when `CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED` is not set to true. In the Supabase SQL editor, check that `case_studies`, `case_study_details`, `case_study_images`, `agent_handoff_log`, and `chat_messages` do not receive new rows after these attempts. Acceptance is met when the UI is read-only, the Edge Functions refuse writes, and no new rows appear during verification.\\n\\n## Idempotence and Recovery\\n\\nThe feature flag and Edge Function guards are reversible by setting `VITE_CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED=true` in the MVP environment and `CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED=true` in the Supabase Edge Function environment.

The MVP client uses `VITE_CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED` (true enables the legacy pipeline; any other value disables it). The Edge Functions use `CASE_STUDY_PIPELINE_ENABLED` with the same semantics. The plan depends on the existing case study UI modules under `directory-platforms/mvp/src/pages` and `directory-platforms/mvp/src/components/case-study`, the data helper in `directory-platforms/mvp/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`, and the Supabase Edge Functions under `directory-platforms/mvp/supabase/functions`.\\n\\n## Revision Notes\\n\\nInitial plan created to disable the legacy MVP case study pipeline with client and server kill switches, without removing data or tables.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace\"}","call_id":"call_W0SpKEwlJEtpHa4cfEHfWJlI"}}

Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js 18+ installed\n- A Supabase account and project\n- A Vercel account (for deployment)\n\n### 2. Supabase Setup\n\n1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)\n2. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings → API\n3. Create a storage bucket named `uploads` in Storage\n4. Run the database migrations using Drizzle:\n\n```bash\nnpm run db:push\n```\n\n### 3. Environment Variables\n\nCopy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:\n\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nRequired environment variables:\n\n- `DATABASE_URL`: Your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string (pooled connection recommended)\n- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL\n- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key\n- `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: Name of your storage bucket (default: `uploads`)\n- `SESSION_SECRET`: Random string for session encryption\n- `PORT`: Server port (default: 5000)\n- `NODE_ENV`: `development` or `production`\n\n### 4. Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### 5. Run Development Server\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThe app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`\n\n## Deployment to Vercel\n\n### Option 1: Deploy via GitHub\n\n1. Push your code to a GitHub repository\n2. Import the repository in Vercel\n3. Add your environment variables in Vercel project settings\n4. Deploy!\n\n### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI\n\n```bash\n# Install Vercel CLI\nnpm i -g vercel\n\n# Deploy\nvercel\n```\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe application uses the following main tables:\n\n- `users`: User authentication and profiles\n- `contractor_profiles`: Contractor business information\n- `projects`: Project portfolios\n- `project_images`: Project gallery images\n- `resources`: CMS articles and guides\n- `claim_requests`: Profile claim requests for review\n\n## Authentication Flow\n\nThe app now uses Supabase Auth instead of Replit OIDC:\n\n1. User signs up/logs in via Supabase Auth UI (implement in frontend)\n2. Access token is sent to `/api/auth/callback`\n3. Server verifies token and creates/updates user in database\n4. Session is stored in PostgreSQL sessions table\n5. Subsequent requests use session-based authentication\n\n## File Storage\n\nFiles are uploaded to Supabase Storage:\n\n1. Client requests upload URL from `/api/objects/upload`\n2. Server generates signed upload URL from Supabase\n3. Client uploads file directly to Supabase Storage\n4. File URL is saved to database\n\n## Available Scripts\n\n- `npm run dev` - Start development server\n- `npm run build` - Build for production\n- `npm start` - Start production server\n- `npm run check` - Type check with TypeScript\n- `npm run db:push` - Push database schema changes\n\n## Key Differences from Replit Version\n\n### Authentication\n\n**Before (Replit)**:\n- Used Replit OIDC for authentication\n- Required REPLIT_DOMAINS environment variable\n- Passport.js with OpenID Connect strategy\n\n**After (Supabase)**:\n- Uses Supabase Auth\n- Token-based authentication\n- Session stored in PostgreSQL\n- Middleware verifies Supabase tokens\n\n### File Storage\n\n**Before (Replit)**:\n- Google Cloud Storage via Replit sidecar\n- Custom ACL management\n- Complex permission system\n\n**After (Supabase)**:\n- Supabase Storage\n- Built-in RLS (Row Level Security)\n- Simpler file management\n\n### Database\n\n**Before (Replit)**:\n- Neon PostgreSQL with WebSocket connections\n- `@neondatabase/serverless` driver\n\n**After (Supabase)**:\n- Supabase PostgreSQL (also Neon-based but managed)\n- Standard `postgres` driver\n- Connection pooling\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Create a feature branch\n2. Make your changes\n3. Test thoroughly\n4. Submit a pull request\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"}}

currently minimal)\n\n## Key Patterns\n- Next.js projects use App Router with app/ routes and server/client component split; Supabase SSR helpers are used for auth/session handling.\n- Directory platform variants share a Drizzle-based schema and split UI (client or app) and API (server) layers.\n- Astro uses Cloudflare Workers/D1 with API routes in src/workers and deployment via wrangler.toml.\n- AI features are integrated via AI SDK/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google GenAI across portfolio and agent tools.\n- Testing spans unit (Vitest/Jest) and E2E (Playwright) per project.\n\n## Database Schema (Summary)\n- knearme-portfolio Supabase schema in knearme-portfolio/supabase/migrations/20260103055338_remote_schema.sql includes core tables for blog/content (blog_posts, blog_tags, blog_comments), business profiles (businesses, contractors, services, service_areas), case studies (case_studies, case_study_images), portfolios/projects (portfolio_items, portfolio_images, projects, project_images), reviews (reviews, review_analysis, review_articles), agent memory and telemetry (agent_memory, agent_handoff_log, ai_usage_log), chat/interview usage (chat_sessions, chat_messages, interview_sessions, voice_usage), prompt templates (prompt_cap_*), search/indexing (queries, query_locations, search_entries, searched_cities), and rank-tracking resources (rt_* tables).\n- directory-platforms/v4 and directory-platforms/supabase Drizzle schemas (shared/schema.ts) define sessions, users, contractor_profiles, projects, and project_images plus shared contractor category taxonomy constants.\n- directory-platforms/astro-main uses Cloudflare D1 with schema/migrations in directory-platforms/astro-main/schema.sql and directory-platforms/astro-main/migrations, covering categories, businesses, reviews, blog posts/tags, business_media, business_hours, and admin users.\n- rank-tracking/local-beacon uses Supabase (with PostGIS noted in project docs) and a shared database package in rank-tracking/local-beacon/packages/database with core types for contractors, projects, and leads.\n- rank-tracking/next-tracker uses Supabase tables for rank tracking such as rt_users, rt_properties, rt_keywords, rt_locations, and rt_rank_history (see rank-tracking/next-tracker/src/types/supabase.ts).\n\n## Integrations\n- Supabase: Auth, Postgres, Storage, SSR helpers (multiple projects).\n- Cloudflare: Pages, Workers, D1 database (astro-main).\n- Cloudflare Access: auth gate referenced in directory-platforms/astro-main docs.\n- Deployment targets documented in project docs, commonly Vercel (Next.js) and Cloudflare Pages (Astro).\n- Neon: serverless Postgres in directory-platforms/v4.\n- Google Cloud Storage: uploads in directory-platforms/v4.\n- Mapbox: geocoding/visualization in rank-tracking/local-beacon.\n- AI providers: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude (business-agent), Google GenAI, AI SDK, OpenAI Codex SDK (business-agent-codex).\n- Observability: Langfuse + OpenTelemetry (knearme-portfolio), Sentry (rank-tracking/local-beacon).\n- Browser automation: Browserbase (rank-tracking/local-beacon).\n- MCP server: knearme-portfolio/mcp-server uses @modelcontextprotocol/sdk.\n"}}

currently minimal)\n+- commands/ (agent command prompts)\n+- .agent/ (system documentation and plans)\n+- src/ (small shared components; currently minimal)\n \n ## Key Patterns\n - Next.js projects use App Router with app/ routes and server/client component split; Supabase SSR helpers are used for auth/session handling.\n-- Directory platform variants share a Drizzle-based schema and split UI (client or app) and API (server) layers.\n-- Astro uses Cloudflare Workers/D1 with API routes in src/workers and deployment via wrangler.toml.\n-- AI features are integrated via AI SDK/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google GenAI across portfolio and agent tools.\n+- Supabase service-role access is used in contractor-review-agent for review ingestion and analysis.\n+- Review-agent-dashboard relies on Supabase admin client for reporting and RPC queries.\n+- MCP server in knearme-portfolio exposes portfolio tooling for external agents.\n+- AI features are integrated via AI SDK/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google GenAI across portfolio and agent tools.\n - Testing spans unit (Vitest/Jest) and E2E (Playwright) per project.\n \n ## Database Schema (Summary)\n - knearme-portfolio Supabase schema in knearme-portfolio/supabase/migrations/20260103055338_remote_schema.sql includes core tables for blog/content (blog_posts, blog_tags, blog_comments), business profiles (businesses, contractors, services, service_areas), case studies (case_studies, case_study_images), portfolios/projects (portfolio_items, portfolio_images, projects, project_images), reviews (reviews, review_analysis, review_articles), agent memory and telemetry (agent_memory, agent_handoff_log, ai_usage_log), chat/interview usage (chat_sessions, chat_messages, interview_sessions, voice_usage), prompt templates (prompt_cap_*), search/indexing (queries, query_locations, search_entries, searched_cities), and rank-tracking resources (rt_* tables).\n-- directory-platforms/v4 and directory-platforms/supabase Drizzle schemas (shared/schema.ts) define sessions, users, contractor_profiles, projects, and project_images plus shared contractor category taxonomy constants.\n-- directory-platforms/astro-main uses Cloudflare D1 with schema/migrations in directory-platforms/astro-main/schema.sql and directory-platforms/astro-main/migrations, covering categories, businesses, reviews, blog posts/tags, business_media, business_hours, and admin users.\n-- rank-tracking/local-beacon uses Supabase (with PostGIS noted in project docs) and a shared database package in rank-tracking/local-beacon/packages/database with core types for contractors, projects, and leads.\n-- rank-tracking/next-tracker uses Supabase tables for rank tracking such as rt_users, rt_properties, rt_keywords, rt_locations, and rt_rank_history (see rank-tracking/next-tracker/src/types/supabase.ts).\n+- review-agent-dashboard reads review_contractors, review_data, review_analysis, review_articles, ai_usage_log, and searched_cities (see review-agent-dashboard/src/lib/supabase/queries.ts).\n+- contractor-review-agent writes review_contractors, review_data, review_analysis, and review_articles (see contractor-review-agent/src/lib/supabase.ts).\n+- Rank-tracking tables (rt_*) remain in the schema as legacy data; code has been removed from the workspace. See .agent/System/legacy_systems_reference.md for historical context.\n \n ## Integrations\n - Supabase: Auth, Postgres, Storage, SSR helpers (multiple projects).\n-- Cloudflare: Pages, Workers, D1 database (astro-main).\n-- Cloudflare Access: auth gate referenced in directory-platforms/astro-main docs.\n-- Deployment targets documented in project docs, commonly Vercel (Next.js) and Cloudflare Pages (Astro).\n-- Neon: serverless Postgres in directory-platforms/v4.\n-- Google Cloud Storage: uploads in directory-platforms/v4.\n-- Mapbox: geocoding/visualization in rank-tracking/local-beacon.\n+- Deployment targets documented in project docs, commonly Vercel for Next.js apps.\n - AI providers: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude (business-agent), Google GenAI, AI SDK, OpenAI Codex SDK (business-agent-codex).\n-- Observability: Langfuse + OpenTelemetry (knearme-portfolio), Sentry (rank-tracking/local-beacon).\n-- Browser automation: Browserbase (rank-tracking/local-beacon).\n+- Observability: Langfuse + OpenTelemetry (knearme-portfolio).\n+- External data providers: DataForSEO (contractor-review-agent).\n - MCP server: knearme-portfolio/mcp-server uses @modelcontextprotocol/sdk.\n*** End Patch"}}

Add sitemap.xml generation (copy from astro-main)\n2. Add robots.txt (copy from astro-main/mvp)\n3. Add test suite (adapt from astro-main)\n4. Optimize bundle size\n5. Consider adopting v4's cleaner code organization\n\n**Alternative: Modernize v4**\n\n1. Replace Replit OIDC with Supabase Auth\n2. Add sitemap generation from astro-main\n3. Add test suite from astro-main\n4. Result: Best of all worlds - clean codebase, modern auth\n\n### For Rank Tracking\n\n**Recommended: Use local-beacon**\n\nlocal-beacon is significantly more complete:\n- AI-powered recommendations (OpenAI + Anthropic)\n- Quick wins service\n- Advanced analytics\n- SERP caching and rate limiting\n- PostGIS for geospatial queries\n\n**Consider merging from next-tracker:**\n- Resource center (guides/tutorials)\n- Cleaner subscription implementation\n- More unit tests\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues to Address\n\n### Directory Platforms\n\n| Repo | Critical Issue | Priority |\n|------|----------------|----------|\n| v4 | Replit OIDC auth needs migration to Supabase Auth | HIGH |\n| supabase | No sitemap or robots.txt | MEDIUM |\n| astro-main | Missing claim system and project portfolio | MEDIUM |\n| mvp | No claim system, over-engineered | LOW |\n\n### Rank Tracking\n\n| Repo | Critical Issue | Priority |\n|------|----------------|----------|\n| next-tracker | No AI features, basic SERP integration | HIGH |\n| local-beacon | Subscription implementation less documented | MEDIUM |\n| local-beacon | Large repo size (2.7G) needs cleanup | LOW |\n\n---\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Directory Platforms\n- `directory-platforms/astro-main/` - Astro + Cloudflare (582M)\n- `directory-platforms/supabase/` - React + Supabase (923M)\n- `directory-platforms/mvp/` - Vite + React MVP (290M)\n- `directory-platforms/v4/` - Vite + React v4 (21M)\n\n### Rank Tracking\n- `rank-tracking/next-tracker/` - Next.js tracker (796M)\n- `rank-tracking/local-beacon/` - Full platform (2.7G)\n\n### Documentation\n- `docs/content-planning/` - Content strategy\n- `docs/business/` - Business planning\n- `docs/agents/` - Agent configurations\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Choose primary directory platform** (recommended: supabase)\n2. **Choose rank tracking platform** (recommended: local-beacon)\n3. **Archive unused repos** after feature extraction\n4. **Merge unique features** from other repos into chosen platforms\n5. **Add missing critical features** (tests, SEO, auth migration)\n\n---\n\n## Disk Space Summary\n\n| Category | Size |\n|----------|------|\n| Directory Platforms | 1.8 GB |\n| Rank Tracking | 3.5 GB |\n| Documentation | ~500 KB |\n| **Total** | ~5.3 GB |\n\nAfter consolidation decision, you can archive or delete unused repos to reclaim 2-4 GB.\n"}}

Production build\n```\n\n## High-Level Architecture Patterns\n\n### Shared Technology Patterns\n\n**Authentication Architecture:**\n- **knearme-portfolio**: Supabase Auth with cookie-based sessions (@supabase/ssr)\n- **directory-platforms/supabase**: Supabase Auth with PostgreSQL session store (express-session)\n- **directory-platforms/astro-main**: Cloudflare Access\n- **rank-tracking**: Supabase Auth with session management\n\n**Database Architecture:**\n- **Supabase projects**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)\n- **Drizzle ORM**: Used in `directory-platforms/supabase` with schema in `shared/schema.ts`\n- **Cloudflare D1**: Used in `directory-platforms/astro-main` (SQLite at edge)\n\n**Storage Architecture:**\n- **Supabase Storage**: Primary file storage for images/uploads\n- **RLS-based permissions**: All storage buckets use Row Level Security\n- **Direct uploads**: Client requests signed URLs, uploads directly to storage\n\n### Common UI Patterns\n\nAll projects use **shadcn/ui** component library with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS:\n- Components located in `src/components/ui/` or `client/src/components/ui/`\n- Dark mode support via `next-themes`\n- Responsive design (mobile-first)\n- Form handling: `react-hook-form` + `zod` validation\n\n### SEO Architecture (Cross-Project Pattern)\n\n**URL Structure Pattern:**\n```\n/{city-slug}/{service-type}/{project-slug}\n\nExamples:\n/denver-co/masonry/chimney-rebuild/historic-brick-restoration\n/lakewood-co/plumbing/pipe-repair/emergency-burst-pipe-fix\n```\n\n**SEO Implementation Checklist:**\n- ✅ **astro-main**: Full implementation (sitemap, robots.txt, structured data)\n- ⚠️ **supabase**: Missing sitemap and robots.txt\n- ⚠️ **knearme-portfolio**: Planned for Phase 2\n- ℹ️ **Reference**: `directory-platforms/astro-main/src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts`\n\n## Critical Cross-Project Patterns\n\n### 1. Supabase Client Initialization\n\n**Server-side (Server Components, API routes):**\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'\nconst supabase = await createClient()  // async\n```\n\n**Client-side (Client Components):**\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'\nconst supabase = createClient()  // sync\n```\n\n**Admin operations (bypasses RLS):**\n```typescript\nimport { createAdminClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'\nconst supabase = createAdminClient()  // use sparingly\n```\n\n### 2. File Upload Pattern (All Supabase Projects)\n\nStandard two-step upload flow:\n1. Client requests signed upload URL: `POST /api/objects/upload`\n2. Client uploads file directly to Supabase Storage using signed URL\n3. Client saves returned file path to database\n4. Files served via: `GET /objects/:objectPath`\n\n**Always normalize paths** using `normalizeObjectEntityPath()` before storing in database.\n\n### 3. Database Migration Pattern\n\n**Drizzle ORM projects** (directory-platforms/supabase):\n```bash\n# 1. Update schema in shared/schema.ts\n# 2. Push changes to database\nnpm run db:push\n```\n\n**Supabase projects** (knearme-portfolio):\n```sql\n-- Create migration in supabase/migrations/XXX_migration_name.sql\n-- Apply via Supabase dashboard or CLI\n```\n\n### 4. Route Group Pattern (Next.js Projects)\n\nNext.js projects use route groups to separate concerns:\n```\napp/\n├── (auth)/         # Unauthenticated flows (login, signup)\n├── (contractor)/   # Authenticated dashboard\n├── (public)/       # Public SEO pages (Server Components)\n└── api/           # API routes\n```\n\n**Key Rule:** Public routes should use Server Components for SEO optimization.\n\n"}}

potential 2-4 GB savings after consolidation.\n\n## Getting Help\n\n### Framework Documentation\n- **Next.js**: https://nextjs.org/docs\n- **Astro**: https://docs.astro.build\n- **React**: https://react.dev\n\n### Service Documentation\n- **Supabase**: https://supabase.com/docs\n- **Cloudflare Pages**: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages\n- **Vercel**: https://vercel.com/docs\n\n### UI/Component Libraries\n- **shadcn/ui**: https://ui.shadcn.com\n- **Radix UI**: https://www.radix-ui.com\n- **Tailwind CSS**: https://tailwindcss.com/docs\n\n### Project-Specific Help\nAlways check the project's own CLAUDE.md file first for detailed implementation guidance.\n\n# Documentation Rules\n\n- Context Loading: Before planning any implementation, always read .agent/README.md to get context.\n- Maintenance: After implementing features, you must update the relevant docs in .agent to reflect changes.\n- Documentation Structure: The .agent folder contains System, Tasks, and SOP subfolders.\n"}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace</cwd>\n  <approval_policy>never</approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"create an exec plan to do the below: Role\nYou are an expert Context Engineer and Codebase Documentation Specialist. Your goal is to optimize this codebase for LLM consumption by creating a structured documentation system. This system will serve as the \"long-term memory\" for future AI agents, allowing them to understand the project architecture, workflows, and decisions without needing to re-read every file in the codebase.\nObjective\nInitialize a documentation directory named .agent and populate it with a structured snapshot of the current codebase. You must analyze the project files, technology stack, and patterns, then generate high-density, low-noise documentation.\nInstructions\nStep 1: Analyze the Codebase\nScan the current directory to understand:\nThe Tech Stack (Languages, Frameworks, Libraries).\nThe Directory Structure.\nKey Components (Database, API, Frontend, Backend).\nExisting configuration files.\nStep 2: Create Directory Structure\nCreate a root folder named .agent (if it doesn't exist) with the following subdirectories:\n.agent/System: For architectural context.\n.agent/Tasks: For PRDs and implementation plans.\n.agent/SOP: For Standard Operating Procedures and \"lessons learned.\"\nStep 3: Generate Core Documentation Files\nCreate the following files with the specific content guidelines below:\nA. .agent/System/project_architecture.md\nGenerate a high-level overview including:\nTech Stack: List all core technologies.\nProject Structure: A conceptual map of key folders and what they contain.\nKey Patterns: How data flows (e.g., Next.js Server Actions, Redux, MVC).\nDatabase Schema: A summary of data models (if applicable).\nIntegrations: List of external APIs or services used.\nB. .agent/README.md (The Index)\nCreate a master index file. This is the first file an agent should read. It must contain:\nA brief 1-sentence description of the project.\nA table of contents linking to all other files in the .agent folder.\nA guide on when to read which file (e.g., \"Read System/project_architecture.md for context on backend logic\").\nC. .agent/SOP/documentation_standards.md\nCreate an initial SOP file describing how to maintain this documentation. It should state:\n\"Always update .agent/System files when changing architecture.\"\n\"Create a new SOP in this folder if a complex task requires a specific workflow.\"\n\"Log major mistakes and how to avoid them in .agent/SOP/mistakes_log.md.\"\nStep 4: Configure Agent Rules (CLAUDE.md)\nCreate or update the root CLAUDE.md file. Add a section titled # Documentation Rules containing:\nContext Loading: \"Before planning any implementation, always read .agent/README.md to get context.\"\nMaintenance: \"After implementing features, you must update the relevant docs in .agent to reflect changes.\"\nDocumentation Structure: Briefly list the .agent folder structure (System, Tasks, SOP).\nStep 5: Create Automation Command (commands/update-doc.md)\nCreate a file at commands/update-doc.md (create the commands folder if needed). This file will serve as a prompt for future updates.\nContent of commands/update-doc.md:\nYou are an expert code documentation expert. Your goal is to do a deep scan & analysis of the codebase to provide super accurate & up-to-date documentation.\nWhen asked to initialize or update documentation:\nPerform a deep scan of the codebase (frontend & backend) to grab full context.\nUpdate .agent/System/project_architecture.md to reflect the current project state (tech stack, structure, DB schema).\nIf there are critical/complex parts, create specific documentation in .agent/System.\nIf we just finished a feature, check .agent/Tasks and mark plans as complete or update findings.\nSOP Generation: If the recent work involved a complex process (e.g., database migration, API integration), generate a reusable SOP in .agent/SOP.\nUpdate .agent/README.md to include an index of all documentation files so we know where to look.\nExecution\nNow, proceed to execute these steps.

Add sitemap.xml generation (copy from astro-main)\n2. Add robots.txt (copy from astro-main/mvp)\n3. Add test suite (adapt from astro-main)\n4. Optimize bundle size\n5. Consider adopting v4's cleaner code organization\n\n**Alternative: Modernize v4**\n\n1. Replace Replit OIDC with Supabase Auth\n2. Add sitemap generation from astro-main\n3. Add test suite from astro-main\n4. Result: Best of all worlds - clean codebase, modern auth\n\n### For Rank Tracking\n\n**Recommended: Use local-beacon**\n\nlocal-beacon is significantly more complete:\n- AI-powered recommendations (OpenAI + Anthropic)\n- Quick wins service\n- Advanced analytics\n- SERP caching and rate limiting\n- PostGIS for geospatial queries\n\n**Consider merging from next-tracker:**\n- Resource center (guides/tutorials)\n- Cleaner subscription implementation\n- More unit tests\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues to Address\n\n### Directory Platforms\n\n| Repo | Critical Issue | Priority |\n|------|----------------|----------|\n| v4 | Replit OIDC auth needs migration to Supabase Auth | HIGH |\n| supabase | No sitemap or robots.txt | MEDIUM |\n| astro-main | Missing claim system and project portfolio | MEDIUM |\n| mvp | No claim system, over-engineered | LOW |\n\n### Rank Tracking\n\n| Repo | Critical Issue | Priority |\n|------|----------------|----------|\n| next-tracker | No AI features, basic SERP integration | HIGH |\n| local-beacon | Subscription implementation less documented | MEDIUM |\n| local-beacon | Large repo size (2.7G) needs cleanup | LOW |\n\n---\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Directory Platforms\n- `directory-platforms/astro-main/` - Astro + Cloudflare (582M)\n- `directory-platforms/supabase/` - React + Supabase (923M)\n- `directory-platforms/mvp/` - Vite + React MVP (290M)\n- `directory-platforms/v4/` - Vite + React v4 (21M)\n"}}

Freeze new writes before disabling its Edge Functions. See .agent/System/phase1_case_study_decommission_checklist.md.\n- Rank tracking (rt_* tables) is useful as a future feature but not part of the MVP; avoid schema changes until an integration plan is approved.\n- Directory platform schemas are legacy references; do not use them as a source of truth for new migrations.\n- The legacy code folders `directory-platforms/` and `rank-tracking/` were removed from the workspace on 2026-01-05; retain this contract as the shared DB reference.\n\n## Notes and cautions\n- Multiple apps use service-role access, which bypasses RLS. Limit new writes to the canonical app when possible.\n- .env files in several apps point to the same Supabase project; do not rotate or delete keys without coordinating across all active systems.\n- If new schema changes are required, update the canonical migration in knearme-portfolio and then validate downstream types (next-tracker and local-beacon) for compatibility.\n"}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Modules\n- App entry and routing live in `src/app`, with feature routes under folders like `(auth)`, `(contractor)`, and `(public)`.\n- Reusable UI and feature components are in `src/components` (for example `src/components/portfolio`, `src/components/forms`, `src/components/ui`).\n- Shared logic resides in `src/hooks`, `src/lib` (Supabase, SEO, utilities), and `src/types`.\n- Product documentation is organized under `docs/01-vision` through `docs/10-launch`; keep architecture and decision records there.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n- Next.js App Router frontend deployed on Vercel, with Supabase providing authentication, PostgreSQL, and file storage.\n- API routes and server actions live under `src/app/api` and server components; call Supabase through helpers in `src/lib/supabase`.\n- Database schema changes belong in `supabase/migrations`; keep C4 diagrams and data model docs up to date in `docs/03-architecture`.\n\n## Build, Dev, and Lint\n- `npm run dev` – start the Next.js dev server.\n- `npm run build` – create a production build; fix all type and lint errors before committing.\n- `npm start` – run the built app locally.\n- `npm run lint` – run ESLint with the Next.js core-web-vitals config; all changes should pass.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming\n- Use TypeScript throughout; prefer explicit types on public functions and shared utilities.\n- Follow React/Next conventions: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for variables and functions, and file-based routing under `src/app`.\n- Keep components small and focused; place shared UI in `src/components/ui` and feature-specific logic in the closest feature folder.\n- Respect existing Tailwind usage from `src/app/globals.css` and utility patterns (`clsx`, `tailwind-merge`).\n\n## Testing & Quality\n- Add lightweight tests or examples near complex logic (for example, utilities in `src/lib/utils.ts`).\n- Before opening a PR, ensure `npm run lint` and `npm run build` succeed and that key flows in `(auth)` and `(contractor)` run locally.\n\n## Security & Configuration\n- Store secrets in `.env.local` (never commit them); required vars include `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and OpenAI API keys.\n- Use the Supabase admin client from `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` only in secure server-side code, and follow `docs/06-security/threat-model.md` for RLS, rate limiting, security headers, and file-upload validation.\n\n## Commits & Pull Requests\n- Write concise, imperative commit messages (for example, `Add contractor onboarding form`, `Fix auth redirect in layout`).\n- For pull requests, include: a short summary, any linked issues, screenshots or GIFs for UI changes, and notes on testing performed.\n- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix; update relevant docs under `docs/` when behavior or architecture changes.\n\n## Messaging Guidelines\n\nWhen writing user-facing copy, marketing content, or UI text:\n\n### Core Message\nKnearMe turns finished projects into shareable proof that wins more jobs. AI handles the writing—the contractor's work is the hero.\n\n### Voice Checklist\n- [ ] Does it focus on the contractor's work, not our technology?\n- [ ] Does it promise outcomes (more jobs) not features (fast/easy)?\n- [ ] Would a busy contractor understand it in 3 seconds?\n- [ ] Does it avoid jargon like \"case study\", \"SEO\", \"AI-powered\"?\n\n### Quick Reference\n- **Hero**: The contractor and their craftsmanship\n- **Villain**: Competitors with better online presence stealing jobs\n- **Solution**: Make every project visible proof that builds trust\n- **Tone**: Direct, practical, tradesperson-friendly\n"}}
