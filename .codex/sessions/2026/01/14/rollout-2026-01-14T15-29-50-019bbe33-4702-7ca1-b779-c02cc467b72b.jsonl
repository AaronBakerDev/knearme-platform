Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"9cbe85da81a6d7c2bafa1f8c395c2a97a0e04b06","branch":"master","repository_url":"https://github.com/AaronBakerDev/knearme-platform.git"}}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Modules\n- App entry and routing live in `src/app`, with feature routes under folders like `(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, `(marketing)`, `(portfolio)`, and `(payload)`.\n- Reusable UI and feature components are in `src/components` (for example `src/components/portfolio`, `src/components/forms`, `src/components/ui`).\n- Shared logic resides in `src/hooks`, `src/lib` (Supabase, SEO, utilities), and `src/types`.\n- Product documentation is organized under `docs/01-vision` through `docs/10-launch`; keep architecture and decision records there.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n- Next.js App Router frontend deployed on Vercel, with Supabase providing authentication, PostgreSQL, and file storage.\n- API routes and server actions live under `src/app/api` and server components; call Supabase through helpers in `src/lib/supabase`.\n- Database schema changes belong in `supabase/migrations`; keep C4 diagrams and data model docs up to date in `docs/03-architecture`.\n\n## Build, Dev, and Lint\n- `npm run dev` – start the Next.js dev server.\n- `npm run build` – create a production build; fix all type and lint errors before committing.\n- `npm start` – run the built app locally.\n- `npm run lint` – run ESLint with the Next.js core-web-vitals config; all changes should pass.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming\n- Use TypeScript throughout; prefer explicit types on public functions and shared utilities.\n- Follow React/Next conventions: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for variables and functions, and file-based routing under `src/app`.\n- Keep components small and focused; place shared UI in `src/components/ui` and feature-specific logic in the closest feature folder.\n- Respect existing Tailwind usage from `src/app/globals.css` and utility patterns (`clsx`, `tailwind-merge`).\n\n## Testing & Quality\n- Add lightweight tests or examples near complex logic (for example, utilities in `src/lib/utils.ts`).\n- Before opening a PR, ensure `npm run lint` and `npm run build` succeed and that key flows in `(auth)` and `(dashboard)` run locally.\n\n## Security & Configuration\n- Store secrets in `.env.local` (never commit them); required vars include `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and OpenAI API keys.\n- Use the Supabase admin client from `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` only in secure server-side code, and follow `docs/06-security/threat-model.md` for RLS, rate limiting, security headers, and file-upload validation.\n\n## Commits & Pull Requests\n- Write concise, imperative commit messages (for example, `Add contractor onboarding form`, `Fix auth redirect in layout`).\n- For pull requests, include: a short summary, any linked issues, screenshots or GIFs for UI changes, and notes on testing performed.\n- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix; update relevant docs under `docs/` when behavior or architecture changes.\n\n## Messaging Guidelines\n\nWhen writing user-facing copy, marketing content, or UI text:\n\n### Core Message\nKnearMe turns finished projects into shareable proof that wins more jobs. AI handles the writing—the contractor's work is the hero.\n\n### Voice Checklist\n- [ ] Does it focus on the contractor's work, not our technology?\n- [ ] Does it promise outcomes (more jobs) not features (fast/easy)?\n- [ ] Would a busy contractor understand it in 3 seconds?\n- [ ] Does it avoid jargon like \"case study\", \"SEO\", \"AI-powered\"?\n\n### Quick Reference\n- **Hero**: The contractor and their craftsmanship\n- **Villain**: Competitors with better online presence stealing jobs\n- **Solution**: Make every project visible proof that builds trust\n- **Tone**: Direct, practical, tradesperson-friendly\n"}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request.

(file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`).

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request.

(file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

{"timestamp":"2026-01-14T20:39:04.172Z","type":"turn_context","payload":{"cwd":"/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace","approval_policy":"never","sandbox_policy":{"type":"workspace-write","network_access":true,"exclude_tmpdir_env_var":false,"exclude_slash_tmp":false},"model":"gpt-5.2-codex","effort":"xhigh","summary":"auto","user_instructions":"# Repository Guidelines\n\nThis workspace is a collection of related KnearMe apps and experiments. Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- dev-browser: Browser automation with persistent page state. Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/dev-browser/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
