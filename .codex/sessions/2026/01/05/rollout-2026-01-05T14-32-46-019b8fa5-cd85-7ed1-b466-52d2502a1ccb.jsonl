The worker will also verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events. A user can run a deployment, execute concrete API requests for each action, and see successful responses from Meta, with tokens cached in KV and clear error handling for missing permissions or invalid inputs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 19:22Z) Reviewed existing worker structure, OAuth flow, KV usage, and current action gaps.\n- [ ] Implement webhook signature validation with `X-Hub-Signature-256` in `src/handlers/webhooks.ts`.\n- [ ] Implement posts handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement analytics handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement ads handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Add end-to-end curl scenarios and verify against a live Meta app.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Wrangler warns that KV namespaces are not inherited by environments, so production must explicitly bind them.\n  Evidence: `wrangler deploy --env production` warning in CLI output.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Keep OAuth flow and token cache design and add new handlers using the same token sources (page tokens and IG tokens).\n  Rationale: This matches the existing worker contract and reduces surface area for credential changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n- Pending: Implementation work has not started yet.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/Desktop/fixmybrick-ai-marketing/apps/production/meta-graph-worker`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in `params.metrics`. For Instagram, use the IG insights endpoint with `ig_account_id`. Cache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, add an `ads` handler module for `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`, `create_campaign`, `update_campaign`, `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, and `get_ad_insights`. Use the Graph API Marketing endpoints with `ad_account_id` and campaign IDs. Ensure the access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for writes, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. Implement a small mapping so `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` translate to status updates.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so these actions are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body and compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n2. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n\n3. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n4. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n5. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` from the worker directory.\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n\n    curl -X POST https://api.knearme.co \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"get_posts\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\"}}'\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance is achieved when:\n\n1. A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and webhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors.\n"}}

Validate.\n    78\t   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` from the worker directory.\n    79\t   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n    80\t\n    81\tExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n    82\t\n    83\t    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n    84\t\n    85\tExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n    86\t\n    87\t    curl -X POST https://api.knearme.co \\\n    88\t      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n    89\t      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    90\t      -d '{\"action\":\"get_posts\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\"}}'\n    91\t\n    92\t## Validation and Acceptance\n    93\t\n    94\tAcceptance is achieved when:\n    95\t\n    96\t1. A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n    97\t2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n    98\t3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n    99\t4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n   100\t5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n   101\t6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n   102\t7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n   103\t\n   104\t## Idempotence and Recovery\n   105\t\n   106\tAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n   107\t\n   108\t## Artifacts and Notes\n   109\t\n   110\tRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n   111\t\n   112\t    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n   113\t\n   114\t## Interfaces and Dependencies\n   115\t\n   116\tUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n   117\t\n   118\tPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and webhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors.\n"}}

It handles OAuth, token\nstorage, rate limiting, caching, and webhook ingestion.\n\n## Scope\n\nImplemented today:\n- Authentication: `oauth_status`, `oauth_connect`, `oauth_verify`, `list_accounts`\n- Comments: `get_comments`, `reply_comment`, `hide_comment`, `unhide_comment`,\n  `delete_comment`, `batch_get_comments`\n- Webhooks: `GET/POST /webhook` (stores events in KV)\n\nNot implemented (actions return \"Not implemented\"):\n- Posts: `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, `schedule_post`\n- Analytics: `get_page_insights`, `get_ig_insights`\n- Ads: `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`, `create_campaign`, `update_campaign`,\n  `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, `get_ad_insights`\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- `POST /` API actions (JSON body with `{ action, params }`)\n- `GET /oauth/callback` OAuth redirect handler\n- `GET /webhook` Meta webhook verification\n- `POST /webhook` Meta webhook events\n\n## Credentials and Configuration\n\nCloudflare:\n- KV namespaces: `META_CACHE`, `META_EVENTS`, `RATE_LIMITER`\n- `wrangler.toml` bindings must match those KV IDs\n\nWorker variables (from `wrangler.toml` / Cloudflare dashboard):\n- `NODE_ENV` (development or production)\n- `GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`)\n- `WORKER_URL` (public base URL used for OAuth redirect)\n\nWorker secrets (set via `wrangler secret put`):\n- `FB_APP_ID` (Meta App ID)\n- `FB_APP_SECRET` (Meta App Secret)\n- `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (random token you choose)\n- `API_SECRET_KEY` (Bearer token for API auth in production)\n\nMeta App (developers.facebook.com):\n- App ID + App Secret\n- Products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API\n- OAuth redirect URI: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n- Webhook callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n- Required permissions (see below)\n\n## Required Meta Permissions\n\nCurrent scopes configured in code:\n- Standard: `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, `instagram_basic`, `ads_read`\n- Advanced (requires app review): `pages_manage_posts`,\n  `pages_manage_metadata`, `instagram_manage_comments`\n\nIf you later enable content publishing or ads management, the code will need:\n- `instagram_content_publish` (currently commented out)\n- `ads_management` (currently commented out)\n\n## Cloudflare Setup\n\n1. Create KV namespaces and update `wrangler.toml` if IDs differ.\n2. Set secrets:\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID`\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET`\n   - `wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - `wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY`\n3. Set `WORKER_URL` for each environment to match the deployed URL.\n4. Deploy with `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy:production`.\n\n## Meta App Setup (Manual)\n\n1. Create a Meta App (Business type is typical).\n2. Add products:\n   - Facebook Login\n   - Webhooks\n   - Instagram Graph API\n3. Configure Facebook Login:\n   - Valid OAuth Redirect URIs: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n4. Configure Webhooks:\n   - Callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Verify Token: your `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - Subscribe to fields used in this worker: `comments`, `feed`, `mentions`,\n     `reactions`\n5. Request advanced permissions (app review) for:\n   - `pages_manage_posts`\n   - `pages_manage_metadata`\n   - `instagram_manage_comments`\n6. Ensure the Instagram Business account is linked to a Facebook Page that the\n   authenticating user administers.\n\n## OAuth Connection Flow\n\n1. Call `oauth_connect` to get an authorization URL.\n2. Open the URL in a browser and grant permissions.\n3. On success, Meta redirects to `/oauth/callback` and tokens are stored in KV.\n4. Call `oauth_verify` or `list_accounts` to confirm accounts are connected.\n\n## Dev-Browser Assisted Setup (Optional)\n\nUse the dev-browser skill to automate the Meta Dashboard setup if you want a\nrepeatable flow. Do not embed usernames or passwords in scripts; log in\ninteractively.\n\n1. Start the dev-browser server:\n   - `cd /Users/aaronbaker/.codex/skills/dev-browser && ./server.sh &`\n2. Create a script in that directory and use `getAISnapshot()` to locate UI\n   elements in the Meta developer dashboard.\n3. Walk through:\n   - Creating or selecting the Meta App\n   - Enabling products (Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API)\n   - Setting OAuth Redirect URI to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n   - Setting Webhook Callback URL to `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Copying App ID and App Secret (store outside git)\n\n## Operational Notes\n\n- Production auth requires `Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>`.\n- Development accepts any Bearer token (for local testing).\n- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute per IP.\n- CORS in production is restricted to `admin.fixmybrick.ca` and related domains.\n  Update `src/utils/cors.ts` if more origins are needed.\n- Webhook POST requests are not currently signature-validated; consider adding\n  `X-Hub-Signature-256` verification with `FB_APP_SECRET` before processing.\n"}}

The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan follows `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/PLANS.md` and must be maintained in accordance with it.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker will provide full, working API coverage for posts, analytics, and ads in addition to the existing auth, comments, and webhooks. The worker will also verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events. A user can run a deployment, execute concrete API requests for each action, and see successful responses from Meta, with tokens cached in KV and clear error handling for missing permissions or invalid inputs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 19:22Z) Reviewed existing worker structure, OAuth flow, KV usage, and current action gaps.\n- [ ] Implement webhook signature validation with `X-Hub-Signature-256` in `src/handlers/webhooks.ts`.\n- [ ] Implement posts handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement analytics handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement ads handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Add end-to-end curl scenarios and verify against a live Meta app.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Wrangler warns that KV namespaces are not inherited by environments, so production must explicitly bind them.\n  Evidence: `wrangler deploy --env production` warning in CLI output.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Keep OAuth flow and token cache design and add new handlers using the same token sources (page tokens and IG tokens).\n  Rationale: This matches the existing worker contract and reduces surface area for credential changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n- Pending: Implementation work has not started yet.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`.\n\nDefault deployments use `wrangler.toml` with no named environment and the\n`WORKER_URL` configured there. Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, Marketing API (ads).\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, add an `ads` handler module for `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`,\n`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`, `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, and\n`get_ad_insights`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and\ncampaign IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure\nthe access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for\nwrites, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If\n`ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error.\nImplement a small mapping so `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` translate to\nstatus updates.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so these actions are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n5. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n6. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n    # Optional after dev validation:\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"get_posts\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\"}}'\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance is achieved when:\n\n1. A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and\nwebhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors. Updated to\nalign repo path, dev setup, deployment targets, and ads token strategy.\n"}}

Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API. Ensure Marketing\n  API access for ads.\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, add an `ads` handler module for `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`,\n`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`, `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, and\n`get_ad_insights`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and\ncampaign IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure\nthe access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for\nwrites, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If\n`ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error.\nImplement a small mapping so `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` translate to\nstatus updates.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so these actions are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n5. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n6. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n"}}

It's an HTTP-based API that apps can use to programmatically query data, post new stories, manage ads, upload photos, and perform a wide variety of other tasks.\\nThe Graph API is named after the idea of a \\\"social graph\\\" — a representation of the information on Facebook. It's composed of nodes, edges, and fields. Typically you use nodes to get data about a specific object, use edges to get collections of objects on a single object, and use fields to get data about a single object or each object in a collection. Throughout our documentation, we may refer to both a node and edge as an \\\"endpoint\\\". For example, \\\"send a `GET` request to the User endpoint\\\".\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/context7/developers_facebook_graph-api/blob/main/get-started.md\\n\\nGet Started > Learn More: You can use the Graph API Explorer to test any request for Users, Pages, Groups, and more.

You can specify sorting direction by appending \\\"_ascending\\\" or \\\"_descending\\\" to the sort field. For example, \\\"reach_descending\\\". For actions, you can sort by action type in form of \\\"actions:<action_type>\\\". For example, [\\\"actions:link_click_ascending\\\"]. This array supports no more than one element. By default, the sorting direction is ascending.\\n- **summary** (list<string>) - If this param is used, a summary section will be included, with the fields listed in this param.\\n- **summary_action_breakdowns** (list<enum{action_device, conversion_destination, matched_persona_id, matched_persona_name, signal_source_bucket, standard_event_content_type, action_canvas_component_name, action_carousel_card_id, action_carousel_card_name, action_destination, action_reaction, action_target_id, action_type, action_video_sound, action_video_type}>) - Similar to `action_breakdowns`, but applies to summary.

Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n5. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n6. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n    # Optional after dev validation:\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"get_posts\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\"}}'\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance is achieved when:\n\n1. A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and\nwebhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors. Updated to\nalign repo path, dev setup, deployment targets, and ads token strategy.\n"}}

Write failing tests for parameter validation and request construction.\n+2. Implement or adjust handler logic to pass.\n+3. Add regression tests for caching and error handling.\n+\n+Unit tests should mock `fetch` plus token/cache helpers and live under\n+`src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`.\n+\n ## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n@@\n 3. Add new handlers.\n    - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n    - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n    - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n    - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n      or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n+\n+3.5 Add tests (TDD).\n+   - Add Vitest configuration and scripts.\n+   - Write unit tests for posts, analytics, ads, and webhook signature validation.\n@@\n-Plan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and\n-webhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors.

Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\nCampaign-level ads handlers already live in `src/handlers/ads.ts` and are wired in `src/worker.ts`. This plan extends them with ad set, ad, creative, and ad image operations, plus additional request parameters in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API. Ensure Marketing\n  API access for ads.\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, add an `ads` handler module for `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`,\n`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`, `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, and\n`get_ad_insights`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and\ncampaign IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure\nthe access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for\nwrites, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If\n`ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error.\nImplement a small mapping so `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` translate to\nstatus updates.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so these actions are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n\nMarketing API (ads):\n- List ad accounts for a user: `GET /<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>/assigned_ad_accounts`\n  with `access_token`.\n- List campaigns: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `objective` as baseline fields).\n- Create campaign: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with\n  `name`, `objective`, `status`, `special_ad_categories`, `access_token`.\n- Ad insights: `GET /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights` with `fields=...` and\n  optional `time_range={since,until}`, `level`, `time_increment`, `filtering`.\n- Campaign update/pause/resume: confirm the exact update endpoint and accepted\n  status values in the Campaign reference before implementation, then codify\n  them here.\n\nGraph API (insights):\n- Page insights: `GET /{page-id}/insights` with `metric=<metric list>`.\n- IG insights: `GET /{instagram_business_account_id}/insights` with\n  `metric=<metric list>`.\n\nAll examples should use `env.GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`) instead of hard\ncoded versions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n"}}

A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. `get_adsets` returns ad sets, `create_adset` creates an ad set with targeting and budget, and `pause_adset`/`resume_adset` update ad set status.\n8. `upload_ad_image` returns an image hash, `create_ad_creative` returns a creative ID, and `create_ad` creates an ad tied to an ad set.\n9. `pause_ad` and `resume_ad` update ad status.\n10. `get_ad_insights` supports `level=adset` and `level=ad` with optional filtering by IDs.\n11. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nExtend `MetaAction` in `src/types/index.ts` with ads lifecycle actions: `get_adsets`, `create_adset`, `update_adset`, `pause_adset`, `resume_adset`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `create_ad_creative`, and `upload_ad_image`. Add `adset_id`, `ad_id`, `adset`, `ad`, `creative`, `creative_id`, `image_url`, `level`, and `filtering` fields to `MetaRequestParams` so ads requests can carry the required payloads.\n\nDefine new interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`:\n\n    export interface AdSetContent {\n      name: string;\n      campaign_id: string;\n      billing_event: string;\n      optimization_goal: string;\n      daily_budget?: number;\n      lifetime_budget?: number;\n      start_time?: string;\n      end_time?: string;\n      status?: 'ACTIVE' | 'PAUSED';\n      targeting: {\n        geo_locations: {\n          countries?: string[];\n          regions?: { key: string }[];\n          cities?: { key: string }[];\n        };\n        age_min?: number;\n        age_max?: number;\n        genders?: number[];\n      };\n    }\n\n    export interface AdCreativeContent {\n      name: string;\n"}}

This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, extend the existing `ads` handler module to include ad sets, ads, ad creatives, and ad image uploads in addition to campaign operations. Add actions for `get_adsets`, `create_adset`, `update_adset`, `pause_adset`, `resume_adset`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `create_ad_creative`, and `upload_ad_image`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and entity IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure the access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for writes, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If `ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error. For ad creatives, support promoting an existing Page post via `object_story_id` and a link-based creative using an `image_hash` from `upload_ad_image`. Extend `get_ad_insights` to accept `level` and `filtering` parameters so callers can request ad set or ad-level insights.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so the expanded ads actions and new request parameters are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## Testing Strategy (TDD)\n\nUse Vitest for unit tests. For each handler:\n\n1. Write failing tests for parameter validation and request construction.\n2. Implement or adjust handler logic to pass.\n3. Add regression tests for caching and error handling.\n\n"}}

Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nExtend `MetaAction` in `src/types/index.ts` with ads lifecycle actions: `get_ad_sets`, `create_ad_set`, `update_ad_set`, `pause_ad_set`, `resume_ad_set`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `create_ad_creative`, and `upload_ad_image`. Add `ad_set_id`, `adset_id` (alias), `ad_id`, `ad_set`, `adset` (alias), `ad`, `ad_creative`, `creative` (alias), `image_url`, `level`, and `filtering` fields to `MetaRequestParams` so ads requests can carry the required payloads.\n\nDefine new interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`:\n\n    export interface AdSetContent {\n      name: string;\n      campaign_id: string;\n      billing_event: string;\n      optimization_goal: string;\n      daily_budget?: number;\n      lifetime_budget?: number;\n      start_time?: string;\n      end_time?: string;\n      status?: 'ACTIVE' | 'PAUSED';\n      targeting: {\n        geo_locations: {\n          countries?: string[];\n          regions?: { key: string }[];\n          cities?: { key: string }[];\n        };\n        age_min?: number;\n        age_max?: number;\n        genders?: number[];\n      };\n    }\n\n    export interface AdCreativeContent {\n      name: string;\n      page_id?: string;\n      object_story_id?: string;\n      link_data?: {\n        link: string;\n        message?: string;\n        image_hash?: string;\n      };\n    }\n\n    export interface AdContent {\n      name: string;\n      adset_id: string;\n      creative_id: string;\n      status?: 'ACTIVE' | 'PAUSED';\n"}}
