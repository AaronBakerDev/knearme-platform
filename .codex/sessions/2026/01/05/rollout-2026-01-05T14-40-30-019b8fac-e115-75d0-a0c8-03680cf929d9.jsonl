Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request.\n---\n\n# Dev Browser Skill\n\nBrowser automation that maintains page state across script executions. Write small, focused scripts to accomplish tasks incrementally. Once you've proven out part of a workflow and there is repeated work to be done, you can write a script to do the repeated work in a single execution.\n\n## Choosing Your Approach\n\n**Local/source-available sites**: If you have access to the source code (e.g., localhost or project files), read the code first to write selectors directly—no need for multi-script discovery.\n\n**Unknown page layouts**: If you don't know the structure of the page, use `getAISnapshot()` to discover elements and `selectSnapshotRef()` to interact with them. The ARIA snapshot provides semantic roles (button, link, heading) and stable refs that persist across script executions.\n\n**Visual feedback**: Take screenshots to see what the user sees and iterate on design or debug layout issues.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, start the dev-browser server using the startup script:\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser\n./server.sh &\n```\n\nThe script will automatically install dependencies and start the server. It will also install Chromium on first run if needed.\n\n### Flags\n\nThe server script accepts the following flags:\n\n- `--headless` - Start the browser in headless mode (no visible browser window). Use if the user asks for it.\n\n**Wait for the `Ready` message before running scripts.** On first run, the server will:\n\n- Install dependencies if needed\n- Download and install Playwright Chromium browser\n- Create the `tmp/` directory for scripts\n- Create the `profiles/` directory for browser data persistence\n\nThe first run may take longer while dependencies are installed. Subsequent runs will start faster.\n\n**Important:** Scripts must be run with `npx tsx` (not `npm run`) due to Playwright WebSocket compatibility.\n\nThe server starts a Chromium browser with a REST API for page management (default: `http://localhost:9222`).\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Server** launches a persistent Chromium browser and manages named pages via REST API\n2. **Client** connects to the HTTP server URL and requests pages by name\n3. **Pages persist** - the server owns all page contexts, so they survive client disconnections\n4. **State is preserved** - cookies, localStorage, DOM state all persist between runs\n\n## Writing Scripts\n\nExecute scripts inline using heredocs—no need to write files for one-off automation.\n\n> **CRITICAL: Always run scripts from `.codex/.home/skills/dev-browser/`**\n>\n> Scripts must be executed from the `.codex/.home/skills/dev-browser/` directory. The `@/` import alias (e.g., `@/client.js`) is configured in this directory's `tsconfig.json` and `package.json`. Running from any other directory will fail with:\n>\n> ```\n> ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@/client.js'\n> ```\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect } from \"@/client.js\";\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"homepage\");\n// Your automation code here\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n**Only write to `tmp/` files when:**\n\n- The script needs to be reused multiple times\n- The script is complex and you need to iterate on it\n- The user explicitly asks for a saved script\n\n### Basic Template\n\nUse the `@/client.js` import path for all scripts.\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"homepage\"); // get or create a named page\nawait page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 800 }); // Required for screenshots\n\n// Your automation code here\nawait page.goto(\"https://example.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page); // Wait for page to fully load\n\n// Always evaluate state at the end\nconst title = await page.title();\nconst url = page.url();\nconsole.log({ title, url });\n\n// Disconnect so the script exits (page stays alive on the server)\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Small scripts**: Each script should do ONE thing (navigate, click, fill, check)\n2. **Evaluate state**: Always log/return state at the end to decide next steps\n3. **Use page names**: Use descriptive names like `\"checkout\"`, `\"login\"`, `\"search-results\"`\n4. **Disconnect to exit**: Call `await client.disconnect()` at the end of your script so the process exits cleanly. Pages persist on the server.\n5. **Plain JS in evaluate**: Always use plain JavaScript inside `page.evaluate()` callbacks—never TypeScript. The code runs in the browser which doesn't understand TS syntax.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **tsx runs without type-checking**: Scripts run with `npx tsx` which transpiles TypeScript but does NOT type-check. Type errors won't prevent execution—they're just ignored.\n- **No TypeScript in browser context**: Code passed to `page.evaluate()`, `page.evaluateHandle()`, or similar methods runs in the browser. Use plain JavaScript only:\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Correct: plain JavaScript in evaluate\nconst text = await page.evaluate(() => {\n  return document.body.innerText;\n});\n\n// ❌ Wrong: TypeScript syntax in evaluate (will fail at runtime)\nconst text = await page.evaluate(() => {\n  const el: HTMLElement = document.body; // TS syntax - don't do this!\n  return el.innerText;\n});\n```\n\n- Names that you give to pages should be descriptive and unique\n\n❌ client.page(\"main\")\n✅ client.page(\"cnn-homepage\")\n\n## Workflow Loop\n\nFollow this pattern for complex tasks:\n\n1. **Write a script** to perform one action\n2. **Run it** and observe the output\n3. **Evaluate** - did it work? What's the current state?\n4. **Decide** - is the task complete or do we need another script?\n5. **Repeat** until task is done\n\n## Client API\n\n```typescript\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"name\"); // Get or create named page\nconst pages = await client.list(); // List all page names\nawait client.close(\"name\"); // Close a page\nawait client.disconnect(); // Disconnect (pages persist)\n\n// ARIA Snapshot methods for element discovery and interaction\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"name\"); // Get ARIA accessibility tree\nconst element = await client.selectSnapshotRef(\"name\", \"e5\"); // Get element by ref\n```\n\nThe `page` object is a standard Playwright Page—use normal Playwright methods.\n\n## Waiting\n\nUse `waitForPageLoad(page)` after navigation (checks document.readyState and network idle):\n\n```typescript\nimport { waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\n// Preferred: Wait for page to fully load\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Wait for specific elements\nawait page.waitForSelector(\".results\");\n\n// Wait for specific URL\nawait page.waitForURL(\"**/success\");\n```\n\n## Inspecting Page State\n\n### Screenshots\n\nTake screenshots when you need to visually inspect the page:\n\n```typescript\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/screenshot.png\" });\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/full.png\", fullPage: true });\n```\n\n### ARIA Snapshot (Element Discovery)\n\nUse `getAISnapshot()` when you don't know the page layout and need to discover what elements are available. It returns a YAML-formatted accessibility tree with:\n\n- **Semantic roles** (button, link, textbox, heading, etc.)\n- **Accessible names** (what screen readers would announce)\n- **Element states** (checked, disabled, expanded, etc.)\n- **Stable refs** that persist across script executions\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.goto(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Get the ARIA accessibility snapshot\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"hackernews\");\nconsole.log(snapshot);\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n#### Example Output\n\nThe snapshot is YAML-formatted with semantic structure:\n\n```yaml\n- banner:\n  - link \"Hacker News\" [ref=e1]\n  - navigation:\n    - link \"new\" [ref=e2]\n    - link \"past\" [ref=e3]\n    - link \"comments\" [ref=e4]\n    - link \"ask\" [ref=e5]\n    - link \"submit\" [ref=e6]\n  - link \"login\" [ref=e7]\n- main:\n  - list:\n    - listitem:\n      - link \"Article Title Here\" [ref=e8]\n      - text: \"528 points by username 3 hours ago\"\n      - link \"328 comments\" [ref=e9]\n- contentinfo:\n  - textbox [ref=e10]\n    - /placeholder: \"Search\"\n```\n\n#### Interpreting the Snapshot\n\n- **Roles** - Semantic element types: `button`, `link`, `textbox`, `heading`, `listitem`, etc.\n- **Names** - Accessible text in quotes: `link \"Click me\"`, `button \"Submit\"`\n- **`[ref=eN]`** - Element reference for interaction. Only assigned to visible, clickable elements\n- **`[checked]`** - Checkbox/radio is checked\n- **`[disabled]`** - Element is disabled\n- **`[expanded]`** - Expandable element (details, accordion) is open\n- **`[level=N]`** - Heading level (h1=1, h2=2, etc.)\n- **`/url:`** - Link URL (shown as a property)\n- **`/placeholder:`** - Input placeholder text\n\n#### Interacting with Refs\n\nUse `selectSnapshotRef()` to get a Playwright ElementHandle for any ref:\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.goto(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Get the snapshot to see available refs\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"hackernews\");\nconsole.log(snapshot);\n// Output shows: - link \"new\" [ref=e2]\n\n// Get the element by ref and click it\nconst element = await client.selectSnapshotRef(\"hackernews\", \"e2\");\nawait element.click();\n\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\nconsole.log(\"Navigated to:\", page.url());\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n## Debugging Tips\n\n1. **Use getAISnapshot** to see what elements are available and their refs\n2. **Take screenshots** when you need visual context\n3. **Use waitForSelector** before interacting with dynamic content\n4. **Check page.url()** to confirm navigation worked\n\n## Error Recovery\n\nIf a script fails, the page state is preserved. You can:\n\n1. Take a screenshot to see what happened\n2. Check the current URL and DOM state\n3. Write a recovery script to get back on track\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/debug.png\" });\nconsole.log({\n  url: page.url(),\n  title: await page.title(),\n  bodyText: await page.textContent(\"body\").then((t) => t?.slice(0, 200)),\n});\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n</skill>"}]}}

Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request.\n---\n\n# Dev Browser Skill\n\nBrowser automation that maintains page state across script executions. Write small, focused scripts to accomplish tasks incrementally. Once you've proven out part of a workflow and there is repeated work to be done, you can write a script to do the repeated work in a single execution.\n\n## Choosing Your Approach\n\n**Local/source-available sites**: If you have access to the source code (e.g., localhost or project files), read the code first to write selectors directly—no need for multi-script discovery.\n\n**Unknown page layouts**: If you don't know the structure of the page, use `getAISnapshot()` to discover elements and `selectSnapshotRef()` to interact with them. The ARIA snapshot provides semantic roles (button, link, heading) and stable refs that persist across script executions.\n\n**Visual feedback**: Take screenshots to see what the user sees and iterate on design or debug layout issues.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, start the dev-browser server using the startup script:\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser\n./server.sh &\n```\n\nThe script will automatically install dependencies and start the server. It will also install Chromium on first run if needed.\n\n### Flags\n\nThe server script accepts the following flags:\n\n- `--headless` - Start the browser in headless mode (no visible browser window). Use if the user asks for it.\n\n**Wait for the `Ready` message before running scripts.** On first run, the server will:\n\n- Install dependencies if needed\n- Download and install Playwright Chromium browser\n- Create the `tmp/` directory for scripts\n- Create the `profiles/` directory for browser data persistence\n\nThe first run may take longer while dependencies are installed. Subsequent runs will start faster.\n\n**Important:** Scripts must be run with `npx tsx` (not `npm run`) due to Playwright WebSocket compatibility.\n\nThe server starts a Chromium browser with a REST API for page management (default: `http://localhost:9222`).\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Server** launches a persistent Chromium browser and manages named pages via REST API\n2. **Client** connects to the HTTP server URL and requests pages by name\n3. **Pages persist** - the server owns all page contexts, so they survive client disconnections\n4. **State is preserved** - cookies, localStorage, DOM state all persist between runs\n\n## Writing Scripts\n\nExecute scripts inline using heredocs—no need to write files for one-off automation.\n\n> **CRITICAL: Always run scripts from `.codex/.home/skills/dev-browser/`**\n>\n> Scripts must be executed from the `.codex/.home/skills/dev-browser/` directory. The `@/` import alias (e.g., `@/client.js`) is configured in this directory's `tsconfig.json` and `package.json`. Running from any other directory will fail with:\n>\n> ```\n> ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@/client.js'\n> ```\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect } from \"@/client.js\";\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"homepage\");\n// Your automation code here\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n**Only write to `tmp/` files when:**\n\n- The script needs to be reused multiple times\n- The script is complex and you need to iterate on it\n- The user explicitly asks for a saved script\n\n### Basic Template\n\nUse the `@/client.js` import path for all scripts.\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"homepage\"); // get or create a named page\nawait page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 800 }); // Required for screenshots\n\n// Your automation code here\nawait page.goto(\"https://example.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page); // Wait for page to fully load\n\n// Always evaluate state at the end\nconst title = await page.title();\nconst url = page.url();\nconsole.log({ title, url });\n\n// Disconnect so the script exits (page stays alive on the server)\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Small scripts**: Each script should do ONE thing (navigate, click, fill, check)\n2. **Evaluate state**: Always log/return state at the end to decide next steps\n3. **Use page names**: Use descriptive names like `\"checkout\"`, `\"login\"`, `\"search-results\"`\n4. **Disconnect to exit**: Call `await client.disconnect()` at the end of your script so the process exits cleanly. Pages persist on the server.\n5. **Plain JS in evaluate**: Always use plain JavaScript inside `page.evaluate()` callbacks—never TypeScript. The code runs in the browser which doesn't understand TS syntax.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **tsx runs without type-checking**: Scripts run with `npx tsx` which transpiles TypeScript but does NOT type-check. Type errors won't prevent execution—they're just ignored.\n- **No TypeScript in browser context**: Code passed to `page.evaluate()`, `page.evaluateHandle()`, or similar methods runs in the browser. Use plain JavaScript only:\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Correct: plain JavaScript in evaluate\nconst text = await page.evaluate(() => {\n  return document.body.innerText;\n});\n\n// ❌ Wrong: TypeScript syntax in evaluate (will fail at runtime)\nconst text = await page.evaluate(() => {\n  const el: HTMLElement = document.body; // TS syntax - don't do this!\n  return el.innerText;\n});\n```\n\n- Names that you give to pages should be descriptive and unique\n\n❌ client.page(\"main\")\n✅ client.page(\"cnn-homepage\")\n\n## Workflow Loop\n\nFollow this pattern for complex tasks:\n\n1. **Write a script** to perform one action\n2. **Run it** and observe the output\n3. **Evaluate** - did it work? What's the current state?\n4. **Decide** - is the task complete or do we need another script?\n5. **Repeat** until task is done\n\n## Client API\n\n```typescript\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"name\"); // Get or create named page\nconst pages = await client.list(); // List all page names\nawait client.close(\"name\"); // Close a page\nawait client.disconnect(); // Disconnect (pages persist)\n\n// ARIA Snapshot methods for element discovery and interaction\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"name\"); // Get ARIA accessibility tree\nconst element = await client.selectSnapshotRef(\"name\", \"e5\"); // Get element by ref\n```\n\nThe `page` object is a standard Playwright Page—use normal Playwright methods.\n\n## Waiting\n\nUse `waitForPageLoad(page)` after navigation (checks document.readyState and network idle):\n\n```typescript\nimport { waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\n// Preferred: Wait for page to fully load\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Wait for specific elements\nawait page.waitForSelector(\".results\");\n\n// Wait for specific URL\nawait page.waitForURL(\"**/success\");\n```\n\n## Inspecting Page State\n\n### Screenshots\n\nTake screenshots when you need to visually inspect the page:\n\n```typescript\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/screenshot.png\" });\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/full.png\", fullPage: true });\n```\n\n### ARIA Snapshot (Element Discovery)\n\nUse `getAISnapshot()` when you don't know the page layout and need to discover what elements are available. It returns a YAML-formatted accessibility tree with:\n\n- **Semantic roles** (button, link, textbox, heading, etc.)\n- **Accessible names** (what screen readers would announce)\n- **Element states** (checked, disabled, expanded, etc.)\n- **Stable refs** that persist across script executions\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.goto(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Get the ARIA accessibility snapshot\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"hackernews\");\nconsole.log(snapshot);\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n#### Example Output\n\nThe snapshot is YAML-formatted with semantic structure:\n\n```yaml\n- banner:\n  - link \"Hacker News\" [ref=e1]\n  - navigation:\n    - link \"new\" [ref=e2]\n    - link \"past\" [ref=e3]\n    - link \"comments\" [ref=e4]\n    - link \"ask\" [ref=e5]\n    - link \"submit\" [ref=e6]\n  - link \"login\" [ref=e7]\n- main:\n  - list:\n    - listitem:\n      - link \"Article Title Here\" [ref=e8]\n      - text: \"528 points by username 3 hours ago\"\n      - link \"328 comments\" [ref=e9]\n- contentinfo:\n  - textbox [ref=e10]\n    - /placeholder: \"Search\"\n```\n\n#### Interpreting the Snapshot\n\n- **Roles** - Semantic element types: `button`, `link`, `textbox`, `heading`, `listitem`, etc.\n- **Names** - Accessible text in quotes: `link \"Click me\"`, `button \"Submit\"`\n- **`[ref=eN]`** - Element reference for interaction. Only assigned to visible, clickable elements\n- **`[checked]`** - Checkbox/radio is checked\n- **`[disabled]`** - Element is disabled\n- **`[expanded]`** - Expandable element (details, accordion) is open\n- **`[level=N]`** - Heading level (h1=1, h2=2, etc.)\n- **`/url:`** - Link URL (shown as a property)\n- **`/placeholder:`** - Input placeholder text\n\n#### Interacting with Refs\n\nUse `selectSnapshotRef()` to get a Playwright ElementHandle for any ref:\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.goto(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Get the snapshot to see available refs\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"hackernews\");\nconsole.log(snapshot);\n// Output shows: - link \"new\" [ref=e2]\n\n// Get the element by ref and click it\nconst element = await client.selectSnapshotRef(\"hackernews\", \"e2\");\nawait element.click();\n\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\nconsole.log(\"Navigated to:\", page.url());\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n## Debugging Tips\n\n1. **Use getAISnapshot** to see what elements are available and their refs\n2. **Take screenshots** when you need visual context\n3. **Use waitForSelector** before interacting with dynamic content\n4. **Check page.url()** to confirm navigation worked\n\n## Error Recovery\n\nIf a script fails, the page state is preserved. You can:\n\n1. Take a screenshot to see what happened\n2. Check the current URL and DOM state\n3. Write a recovery script to get back on track\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/debug.png\" });\nconsole.log({\n  url: page.url(),\n  title: await page.title(),\n  bodyText: await page.textContent(\"body\").then((t) => t?.slice(0, 200)),\n});\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n"}}

Treat the reader as a complete beginner to this repository: they have only the current working tree and the single ExecPlan file you provide. There is no memory of prior plans and no external context.\n\n## How to use ExecPlans and PLANS.md\n\nWhen authoring an executable specification (ExecPlan), follow PLANS.md to the letter. If it is not in your context, refresh your memory by reading the entire PLANS.md file. Be thorough in reading (and re-reading) source material to produce an accurate specification. When creating a spec, start from the skeleton and flesh it out as you do your research.\n\nWhen implementing an executable specification (ExecPlan), do not prompt the user for \"next steps\"; simply proceed to the next milestone. Keep all sections up to date, add or split entries in the list at every stopping point to affirmatively state the progress made and next steps. Resolve ambiguities autonomously, and commit frequently.\n\nWhen discussing an executable specification (ExecPlan), record decisions in a log in the spec for posterity; it should be unambiguously clear why any change to the specification was made. ExecPlans are living documents, and it should always be possible to restart from only the ExecPlan and no other work.\n\nWhen researching a design with challenging requirements or significant unknowns, use milestones to implement proof of concepts, \"toy implementations\", etc., that allow validating whether the user's proposal is feasible. Read the source code of libraries by finding or acquiring them, research deeply, and include prototypes to guide a fuller implementation.\n\n## Requirements\n\nNON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Every ExecPlan must be fully self-contained. Self-contained means that in its current form it contains all knowledge and instructions needed for a novice to succeed.\n* Every ExecPlan is a living document. Contributors are required to revise it as progress is made, as discoveries occur, and as design decisions are finalized. Each revision must remain fully self-contained.\n* Every ExecPlan must enable a complete novice to implement the feature end-to-end without prior knowledge of this repo.\n* Every ExecPlan must produce a demonstrably working behavior, not merely code changes to \"meet a definition\".\n* Every ExecPlan must define every term of art in plain language or do not use it.\n\nPurpose and intent come first. Begin by explaining, in a few sentences, why the work matters from a user's perspective: what someone can do after this change that they could not do before, and how to see it working. Then guide the reader through the exact steps to achieve that outcome, including what to edit, what to run, and what they should observe.\n\nThe agent executing your plan can list files, read files, search, run the project, and run tests. It does not know any prior context and cannot infer what you meant from earlier milestones. Repeat any assumption you rely on. Do not point to external blogs or docs; if knowledge is required, embed it in the plan itself in your own words. If an ExecPlan builds upon a prior ExecPlan and that file is checked in, incorporate it by reference. If it is not, you must include all relevant context from that plan.\n\n## Formatting\n\nFormat and envelope are simple and strict. Each ExecPlan must be one single fenced code block labeled as `md` that begins and ends with triple backticks. Do not nest additional triple-backtick code fences inside; when you need to show commands, transcripts, diffs, or code, present them as indented blocks within that single fence. Use indentation for clarity rather than code fences inside an ExecPlan to avoid prematurely closing the ExecPlan's code fence. Use two newlines after every heading, use # and ## and so on, and correct syntax for ordered and unordered lists.\n\nWhen writing an ExecPlan to a Markdown (.md) file where the content of the file is only the single ExecPlan, you should omit the triple backticks.\n\nWrite in plain prose. Prefer sentences over lists. Avoid checklists, tables, and long enumerations unless brevity would obscure meaning. Checklists are permitted only in the `Progress` section, where they are mandatory. Narrative sections must remain prose-first.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nSelf-containment and plain language are paramount. If you introduce a phrase that is not ordinary English (\"daemon\", \"middleware\", \"RPC gateway\", \"filter graph\"), define it immediately and remind the reader how it manifests in this repository (for example, by naming the files or commands where it appears). Do not say \"as defined previously\" or \"according to the architecture doc.\" Include the needed explanation here, even if you repeat yourself.\n\nAvoid common failure modes. Do not rely on undefined jargon. Do not describe \"the letter of a feature\" so narrowly that the resulting code compiles but does nothing meaningful. Do not outsource key decisions to the reader. When ambiguity exists, resolve it in the plan itself and explain why you chose that path. Err on the side of over-explaining user-visible effects and under-specifying incidental implementation details.\n\nAnchor the plan with observable outcomes. State what the user can do after implementation, the commands to run, and the outputs they should see. Acceptance should be phrased as behavior a human can verify (\"after starting the server, navigating to http://localhost:8080/health returns HTTP 200 with body OK\") rather than internal attributes (\"added a HealthCheck struct\"). If a change is internal, explain how its impact can still be demonstrated (for example, by running tests that fail before and pass after, and by showing a scenario that uses the new behavior).\n\nSpecify repository context explicitly. Name files with full repository-relative paths, name functions and modules precisely, and describe where new files should be created. If touching multiple areas, include a short orientation paragraph that explains how those parts fit together so a novice can navigate confidently. When running commands, show the working directory and exact command line. When outcomes depend on environment, state the assumptions and provide alternatives when reasonable.\n\nBe idempotent and safe. Write the steps so they can be run multiple times without causing damage or drift. If a step can fail halfway, include how to retry or adapt. If a migration or destructive operation is necessary, spell out backups or safe fallbacks. Prefer additive, testable changes that can be validated as you go.\n\nValidation is not optional. Include instructions to run tests, to start the system if applicable, and to observe it doing something useful. Describe comprehensive testing for any new features or capabilities. Include expected outputs and error messages so a novice can tell success from failure. Where possible, show how to prove that the change is effective beyond compilation (for example, through a small end-to-end scenario, a CLI invocation, or an HTTP request/response transcript). State the exact test commands appropriate to the project's toolchain and how to interpret their results.\n\nCapture evidence. When your steps produce terminal output, short diffs, or logs, include them inside the single fenced block as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success. If you need to include a patch, prefer file-scoped diffs or small excerpts that a reader can recreate by following your instructions rather than pasting large blobs.\n\n## Milestones\n\nMilestones are narrative, not bureaucracy. If you break the work into milestones, introduce each with a brief paragraph that describes the scope, what will exist at the end of the milestone that did not exist before, the commands to run, and the acceptance you expect to observe. Keep it readable as a story: goal, work, result, proof. Progress and milestones are distinct: milestones tell the story, progress tracks granular work. Both must exist. Never abbreviate a milestone merely for the sake of brevity, do not leave out details that could be crucial to a future implementation.\n\nEach milestone must be independently verifiable and incrementally implement the overall goal of the execution plan.\n\n## Living plans and design decisions\n\n* ExecPlans are living documents. As you make key design decisions, update the plan to record both the decision and the thinking behind it. Record all decisions in the `Decision Log` section.\n* ExecPlans must contain and maintain a `Progress` section, a `Surprises & Discoveries` section, a `Decision Log`, and an `Outcomes & Retrospective` section. These are not optional.\n* When you discover optimizer behavior, performance tradeoffs, unexpected bugs, or inverse/unapply semantics that shaped your approach, capture those observations in the `Surprises & Discoveries` section with short evidence snippets (test output is ideal).\n* If you change course mid-implementation, document why in the `Decision Log` and reflect the implications in `Progress`. Plans are guides for the next contributor as much as checklists for you.\n* At completion of a major task or the full plan, write an `Outcomes & Retrospective` entry summarizing what was achieved, what remains, and lessons learned.\n\n# Prototyping milestones and parallel implementations\n\nIt is acceptable -- and often encouraged -- to include explicit prototyping milestones when they de-risk a larger change. Examples: adding a low-level operator to a dependency to validate feasibility, or exploring two composition orders while measuring optimizer effects. Keep prototypes additive and testable. Clearly label the scope as \"prototyping\"; describe how to run and observe results; and state the criteria for promoting or discarding the prototype.\n\nPrefer additive code changes followed by subtractions that keep tests passing. Parallel implementations (e.g., keeping an adapter alongside an older path during migration) are fine when they reduce risk or enable tests to continue passing during a large migration. Describe how to validate both paths and how to retire one safely with tests. When working with multiple new libraries or feature areas, consider creating spikes that evaluate the feasibility of these features independently of one another, proving that the external library performs as expected and implements the features we need in isolation.\n\n## Skeleton of a Good ExecPlan\n\n```md\n# <Short, action-oriented description>\n\nThis ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nIf PLANS.md file is checked into the repo, reference the path to that file here from the repository root and note that this document must be maintained in accordance with PLANS.md.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nExplain in a few sentences what someone gains after this change and how they can see it working. State the user-visible behavior you will enable.\n\n## Progress\n\nUse a list with checkboxes to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here, even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two (\"done\" vs. \"remaining\"). This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.\n\n- [x] (2025-10-01 13:00Z) Example completed step.\n- [ ] Example incomplete step.\n- [ ] Example partially completed step (completed: X; remaining: Y).\n\nUse timestamps to measure rates of progress.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\nDocument unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during implementation. Provide concise evidence.\n\n- Observation: ...\n  Evidence: ...\n\n## Decision Log\n\nRecord every decision made while working on the plan in the format:\n\n- Decision: ...\n  Rationale: ...\n  Date/Author: ...\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\nSummarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned at major milestones or at completion. Compare the result against the original purpose.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nDescribe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name the key files and modules by full path. Define any non-obvious term you will use. Do not refer to prior plans.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nDescribe, in prose, the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location (function, module) and what to insert or change. Keep it concrete and minimal.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\nState the exact commands to run and where to run them (working directory). When a command generates output, show a short expected transcript so the reader can compare. This section must be updated as work proceeds.\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nDescribe how to start or exercise the system and what to observe. Phrase acceptance as behavior, with specific inputs and outputs. If tests are involved, say \"run <project's test command> and expect <N> passed; the new test <name> fails before the change and passes after\".\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nIf steps can be repeated safely, say so. If a step is risky, provide a safe retry or rollback path. Keep the environment clean after completion.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nInclude the most important transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success.\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nBe prescriptive. Name the libraries, modules, and services to use and why. Specify the types, traits/interfaces, and function signatures that must exist at the end of the milestone. Prefer stable names and paths such as `crate::module::function` or `package.submodule.Interface`. E.g.:\n\nIn crates/foo/planner.rs, define:\n\n    pub trait Planner {\n        fn plan(&self, observed: &Observed) -> Vec<Action>;\n    }\n```\n\nIf you follow the guidance above, a single, stateless agent -- or a human novice -- can read your ExecPlan from top to bottom and produce a working, observable result. That is the bar: SELF-CONTAINED, SELF-SUFFICIENT, NOVICE-GUIDING, OUTCOME-FOCUSED.\n\nWhen you revise a plan, you must ensure your changes are comprehensively reflected across all sections, including the living document sections, and you must write a note at the bottom of the plan describing the change and the reason why. ExecPlans must describe not just the what but the why for almost everything.\n"}}

State the user-visible behavior you will enable.\n\n## Progress\n\nUse a list with checkboxes to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here, even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two (\"done\" vs. \"remaining\"). This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.\n\n- [ ] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ) Example incomplete step.\n\nUse timestamps to measure rates of progress.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\nDocument unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during implementation.

Compare the result against the original purpose.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nDescribe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name the key files and modules by full path. Define any non-obvious term you will use. Do not refer to prior plans.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nDescribe, in prose, the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location (function, module) and what to insert or change. Keep it concrete and minimal.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\nState the exact commands to run and where to run them (working directory). When a command generates output, show a short expected transcript so the reader can compare. This section must be updated as work proceeds.\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nDescribe how to start or exercise the system and what to observe. Phrase acceptance as behavior, with specific inputs and outputs. If tests are involved, say \"run <project's test command> and expect <N> passed; the new test <name> fails before the change and passes after\".\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nIf steps can be repeated safely, say so. If a step is risky, provide a safe retry or rollback path. Keep the environment clean after completion.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nInclude the most important transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success.\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nBe prescriptive. Name the libraries, modules, and services to use and why. Specify the types, traits/interfaces, and function signatures that must exist at the end of the milestone. Prefer stable names and paths such as `crate::module::function` or `package.submodule.Interface`. E.g.:\n\nIn crates/foo/planner.rs, define:\n\n    pub trait Planner {\n        fn plan(&self, observed: &Observed) -> Vec<Action>;\n    }\n"}}

It handles OAuth, token\nstorage, rate limiting, caching, and webhook ingestion.\n\n## Scope\n\nImplemented today:\n- Authentication: `oauth_status`, `oauth_connect`, `oauth_verify`, `list_accounts`\n- Comments: `get_comments`, `reply_comment`, `hide_comment`, `unhide_comment`,\n  `delete_comment`, `batch_get_comments`\n- Webhooks: `GET/POST /webhook` (stores events in KV)\n\nNot implemented (actions return \"Not implemented\"):\n- Posts: `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, `schedule_post`\n- Analytics: `get_page_insights`, `get_ig_insights`\n- Ads: `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`, `create_campaign`, `update_campaign`,\n  `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, `get_ad_insights`\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- `POST /` API actions (JSON body with `{ action, params }`)\n- `GET /oauth/callback` OAuth redirect handler\n- `GET /webhook` Meta webhook verification\n- `POST /webhook` Meta webhook events\n\n## Credentials and Configuration\n\nCloudflare:\n- KV namespaces: `META_CACHE`, `META_EVENTS`, `RATE_LIMITER`\n- `wrangler.toml` bindings must match those KV IDs\n\nWorker variables (from `wrangler.toml` / Cloudflare dashboard):\n- `NODE_ENV` (development or production)\n- `GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`)\n- `WORKER_URL` (public base URL used for OAuth redirect)\n\nWorker secrets (set via `wrangler secret put`):\n- `FB_APP_ID` (Meta App ID)\n- `FB_APP_SECRET` (Meta App Secret)\n- `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (random token you choose)\n- `API_SECRET_KEY` (Bearer token for API auth in production)\n\nMeta App (developers.facebook.com):\n- App ID + App Secret\n- Products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API\n- OAuth redirect URI: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n- Webhook callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n- Required permissions (see below)\n\n## Required Meta Permissions\n\nCurrent scopes configured in code:\n- Standard: `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, `instagram_basic`, `ads_read`\n- Advanced (requires app review): `pages_manage_posts`,\n  `pages_manage_metadata`, `instagram_manage_comments`\n\nIf you later enable content publishing or ads management, the code will need:\n- `instagram_content_publish` (currently commented out)\n- `ads_management` (currently commented out)\n\n## Cloudflare Setup\n\n1. Create KV namespaces and update `wrangler.toml` if IDs differ.\n2. Set secrets:\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID`\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET`\n   - `wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - `wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY`\n3. Set `WORKER_URL` for each environment to match the deployed URL.\n4. Deploy with `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy:production`.\n\n## Meta App Setup (Manual)\n\n1. Create a Meta App (Business type is typical).\n2. Add products:\n   - Facebook Login\n   - Webhooks\n   - Instagram Graph API\n3. Configure Facebook Login:\n   - Valid OAuth Redirect URIs: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n4. Configure Webhooks:\n   - Callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Verify Token: your `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - Subscribe to fields used in this worker: `comments`, `feed`, `mentions`,\n     `reactions`\n5. Request advanced permissions (app review) for:\n   - `pages_manage_posts`\n   - `pages_manage_metadata`\n   - `instagram_manage_comments`\n6. Ensure the Instagram Business account is linked to a Facebook Page that the\n   authenticating user administers.\n\n## OAuth Connection Flow\n\n1. Call `oauth_connect` to get an authorization URL.\n2. Open the URL in a browser and grant permissions.\n3. On success, Meta redirects to `/oauth/callback` and tokens are stored in KV.\n4. Call `oauth_verify` or `list_accounts` to confirm accounts are connected.\n\n## Dev-Browser Assisted Setup (Optional)\n\nUse the dev-browser skill to automate the Meta Dashboard setup if you want a\nrepeatable flow. Do not embed usernames or passwords in scripts; log in\ninteractively.\n\n1. Start the dev-browser server:\n   - `cd /Users/aaronbaker/.codex/skills/dev-browser && ./server.sh &`\n2. Create a script in that directory and use `getAISnapshot()` to locate UI\n   elements in the Meta developer dashboard.\n3. Walk through:\n   - Creating or selecting the Meta App\n   - Enabling products (Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API)\n   - Setting OAuth Redirect URI to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n   - Setting Webhook Callback URL to `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Copying App ID and App Secret (store outside git)\n\n## Operational Notes\n\n- Production auth requires `Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>`.\n- Development accepts any Bearer token (for local testing).\n- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute per IP.\n- CORS in production is restricted to `admin.fixmybrick.ca` and related domains.\n  Update `src/utils/cors.ts` if more origins are needed.\n- Webhook POST requests are not currently signature-validated; consider adding\n  `X-Hub-Signature-256` verification with `FB_APP_SECRET` before processing.\n"}}

The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan follows `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/PLANS.md` and must be maintained in accordance with it.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker will provide full, working API coverage for posts, analytics, and ads in addition to the existing auth, comments, and webhooks. The worker will also verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events. A user can run a deployment, execute concrete API requests for each action, and see successful responses from Meta, with tokens cached in KV and clear error handling for missing permissions or invalid inputs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 19:22Z) Reviewed existing worker structure, OAuth flow, KV usage, and current action gaps.\n- [ ] Implement webhook signature validation with `X-Hub-Signature-256` in `src/handlers/webhooks.ts`.\n- [ ] Implement posts handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement analytics handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement ads handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Add end-to-end curl scenarios and verify against a live Meta app.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Wrangler warns that KV namespaces are not inherited by environments, so production must explicitly bind them.\n  Evidence: `wrangler deploy --env production` warning in CLI output.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Keep OAuth flow and token cache design; use page/IG tokens for page\n  and IG endpoints, and the user token for ads endpoints.\n  Rationale: This matches the existing worker contract and reduces surface area for credential changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n- Pending: Implementation work has not started yet.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`.\n\nDefault deployments use `wrangler.toml` with no named environment and the\n`WORKER_URL` configured there. Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API. Ensure Marketing\n  API access for ads.\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, add an `ads` handler module for `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`,\n`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`, `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, and\n`get_ad_insights`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and\ncampaign IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure\nthe access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for\nwrites, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If\n`ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error.\nImplement a small mapping so `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` translate to\nstatus updates.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so these actions are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n5. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n6. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n    # Optional after dev validation:\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"get_posts\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\"}}'\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance is achieved when:\n\n1. A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and\nwebhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors. Updated to\nalign repo path, dev setup, deployment targets, and ads token strategy.\n"}}

You can complete OAuth, list connected accounts, and successfully call the worker for auth, comments, webhooks, and (after running the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`) posts, analytics, and ads.

No setup work has been executed yet.\n+\n+## Context and Orientation\n+\n+The worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`. The main configuration lives in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`, which defines the dev `WORKER_URL`, KV namespace bindings, and environment variables. The setup expectations are summarized in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`. The implementation gaps for posts, analytics, and ads are covered in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, which must be completed after this setup plan to make all endpoints functional.\n+\n+A “Meta App” is the developer application configured in the Meta Developer Dashboard. A “Facebook Page” is a business Page owned by Fix My Brick. An “Instagram Business account” is an Instagram profile linked to a Facebook Page. An “ad account” is the account that owns ad campaigns. A “Cloudflare Worker” is the deployed script in `src/worker.ts` that exposes API endpoints. A “KV namespace” is Cloudflare’s key-value storage used by the worker for tokens and caching. `WORKER_URL` is the public base URL of the worker, and `API_SECRET_KEY` is the Bearer token used to authorize requests in production.\n+\n+## Plan of Work\n+\n+First, create a private inventory note outside the repository and record the Meta app name, App ID, product enablement state, and the full list of Fix My Brick assets (Page IDs, IG Business IDs, ad account IDs) so the setup can be repeated without re-discovery. This inventory must not include secrets, but should include where the secrets are stored.\n+\n+Next, configure the Meta app named “KnearMe Meta Integration.” Enable Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and Marketing API (if ads will be used). Set the OAuth redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`, configure the webhook callback at `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with the chosen verify token, and subscribe to the fields used by the worker: comments, feed, mentions, and reactions. Add the Fix My Brick test accounts to the app’s roles or testers so they can authorize in development mode.\n+\n+Then, ensure that all Fix My Brick Pages and Instagram Business accounts are connected and that each test user is an admin of those assets. Confirm ad account access if ads endpoints are in scope, and capture the asset IDs in the inventory note.\n+\n+After the Meta app is configured, set Cloudflare secrets and variables for the worker. Confirm or update KV namespace bindings in `wrangler.toml`, set the dev `WORKER_URL`, and deploy the worker to the dev environment. This step makes the OAuth redirect and webhook endpoint live.\n+\n+Finally, perform the OAuth flow to cache tokens, validate the existing auth/comments/webhooks endpoints, and then run the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to add posts, analytics, and ads endpoints. After implementation, run the end-to-end validations described below.\n+\n+## Concrete Steps\n+\n+Create a private inventory note outside git and record asset IDs and references to where secrets are stored. Use a location like `~/.knearme/meta-graph-worker-inventory.md` or another private location. The inventory should contain the app name, App ID, `WORKER_URL`, and the full list of Fix My Brick Page, IG Business, and ad account IDs. Do not store the App Secret or API keys in this file; instead, record where those secrets are stored (for example, in a password manager entry name).\n+\n+From `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`, ensure KV namespaces exist. If you need new ones, run:\n+\n+    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_CACHE\n+    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_EVENTS\n+    npx wrangler kv:namespace create RATE_LIMITER\n+\n+Each command prints a new ID. If new IDs are created, update the bindings in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` to match. Re-run the command only if the namespace does not exist; if it already exists, skip creation and keep the existing IDs in `wrangler.toml`.\n+\n+Set secrets for the worker (run each command and paste the secret when prompted):\n+\n+    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID\n+    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET\n+    npx wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN\n+    npx wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY\n+\n+Confirm the dev `WORKER_URL` in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` matches the value you will use in the Meta app settings. If it changes, update it before deploying.\n+\n+Deploy the worker in dev mode from `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`:\n+\n+    npx wrangler deploy\n+\n+The output should show a published worker URL that matches `WORKER_URL`.\n+\n+Generate the OAuth URL by calling the worker and open it in a browser:\n+\n+    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n+      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n+      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n+      -d '{\"action\":\"oauth_connect\"}'\n+\n+Expect a JSON response containing an `auth_url`. Open that URL, authenticate as a Fix My Brick test user, and complete the consent screen. This will redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback` and cache tokens.\n+\n+Verify the connection by listing accounts:\n+\n+    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n+      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n+      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n+      -d '{\"action\":\"list_accounts\"}'\n+\n+Expect a response with pages and linked Instagram accounts. Compare the IDs to your inventory.\n+\n+Validate webhooks by simulating a verification request:\n+\n+    curl \"<WORKER_URL>/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=<WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN>&hub.challenge=12345\"\n+\n+Expect the response body to be `12345`. A mismatch indicates the verify token is wrong.\n+\n+Validate comments endpoints using a real post ID from a Fix My Brick Page. Use the examples in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`, and confirm successful responses.\n+\n+After completing the setup, run `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to implement posts, analytics, and ads actions. Then validate each action with a real asset ID and record successful responses in your private inventory note.\n+\n+## Validation and Acceptance\n+\n+Acceptance for this setup plan is achieved when the inventory note exists and includes all Fix My Brick asset IDs, the Meta app is configured with the correct products and redirect/webhook URLs, and the worker is deployed with the correct secrets and `WORKER_URL`. The OAuth flow must succeed, `list_accounts` must return all expected Pages and Instagram accounts, and the webhook verification endpoint must echo the challenge for the configured verify token. After the implementation plan is executed, posts, analytics, and ads endpoints must return successful responses against real assets.\n+\n+## Idempotence and Recovery\n+\n+The setup steps are safe to repeat. Re-running `wrangler secret put` overwrites the secret value, which is safe if you provide the same value or intentionally rotate it. If a KV namespace ID changes, update `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` and redeploy. If OAuth fails, repeat `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow again; the worker will overwrite cached tokens. If webhook verification fails, confirm the verify token in both Meta and Cloudflare secrets, then retry.\n+\n+## Artifacts and Notes\n+\n+Keep short evidence snippets in your private inventory note, such as the `list_accounts` response and the webhook verification echo. Example structure:\n+\n+    Meta App: KnearMe Meta Integration\n+    App ID: 123456789012345\n+    WORKER_URL (dev): https://meta-graph-worker.floral-breeze-0a38.workers.dev\n+    Pages: Fix My Brick - City A (ID 111...), Fix My Brick - City B (ID 222...)\n+    IG Business: @fixmybrick_citya (ID 333...), @fixmybrick_cityb (ID 444...)\n+    Ad accounts: act_555..., act_666...\n+    Secrets stored in: 1Password entry \"KnearMe Meta Integration\"\n+    list_accounts result saved: 2026-01-05\n+    webhook verify echo: 12345\n+\n+## Interfaces and Dependencies\n+\n+The setup depends on the Cloudflare Worker defined by `src/worker.ts` and its configuration in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`. It assumes the existing auth and comments actions defined in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` are working and that OAuth redirects use `WORKER_URL`. The setup also depends on the Meta app being configured with Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and (for ads) Marketing API, and on the Fix My Brick test accounts having asset access. Completion of the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` is required for posts, analytics, and ads actions to be available.\n+\n+Plan revision notes: Initial version created to inventory and configure the Meta app, assets, and Cloudflare worker before completing missing endpoint implementations.\n*** End Patch"}}

Use when users ask to navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract web data, test web apps, or automate browser workflows. Trigger phrases include \"go to [url]\", \"click on\", \"fill out the form\", \"take a screenshot\", \"scrape\", \"automate\", \"test the website\", \"log into\", or any browser interaction request.\n---\n\n# Dev Browser Skill\n\nBrowser automation that maintains page state across script executions. Write small, focused scripts to accomplish tasks incrementally. Once you've proven out part of a workflow and there is repeated work to be done, you can write a script to do the repeated work in a single execution.\n\n## Choosing Your Approach\n\n**Local/source-available sites**: If you have access to the source code (e.g., localhost or project files), read the code first to write selectors directly—no need for multi-script discovery.\n\n**Unknown page layouts**: If you don't know the structure of the page, use `getAISnapshot()` to discover elements and `selectSnapshotRef()` to interact with them. The ARIA snapshot provides semantic roles (button, link, heading) and stable refs that persist across script executions.\n\n**Visual feedback**: Take screenshots to see what the user sees and iterate on design or debug layout issues.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, start the dev-browser server using the startup script:\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser\n./server.sh &\n```\n\nThe script will automatically install dependencies and start the server. It will also install Chromium on first run if needed.\n\n### Flags\n\nThe server script accepts the following flags:\n\n- `--headless` - Start the browser in headless mode (no visible browser window). Use if the user asks for it.\n\n**Wait for the `Ready` message before running scripts.** On first run, the server will:\n\n- Install dependencies if needed\n- Download and install Playwright Chromium browser\n- Create the `tmp/` directory for scripts\n- Create the `profiles/` directory for browser data persistence\n\nThe first run may take longer while dependencies are installed. Subsequent runs will start faster.\n\n**Important:** Scripts must be run with `npx tsx` (not `npm run`) due to Playwright WebSocket compatibility.\n\nThe server starts a Chromium browser with a REST API for page management (default: `http://localhost:9222`).\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Server** launches a persistent Chromium browser and manages named pages via REST API\n2. **Client** connects to the HTTP server URL and requests pages by name\n3. **Pages persist** - the server owns all page contexts, so they survive client disconnections\n4. **State is preserved** - cookies, localStorage, DOM state all persist between runs\n\n## Writing Scripts\n\nExecute scripts inline using heredocs—no need to write files for one-off automation.\n\n> **CRITICAL: Always run scripts from `.codex/.home/skills/dev-browser/`**\n>\n> Scripts must be executed from the `.codex/.home/skills/dev-browser/` directory. The `@/` import alias (e.g., `@/client.js`) is configured in this directory's `tsconfig.json` and `package.json`. Running from any other directory will fail with:\n>\n> ```\n> ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@/client.js'\n> ```\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect } from \"@/client.js\";\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"homepage\");\n// Your automation code here\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n**Only write to `tmp/` files when:**\n\n- The script needs to be reused multiple times\n- The script is complex and you need to iterate on it\n- The user explicitly asks for a saved script\n\n### Basic Template\n\nUse the `@/client.js` import path for all scripts.\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"homepage\"); // get or create a named page\nawait page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 800 }); // Required for screenshots\n\n// Your automation code here\nawait page.goto(\"https://example.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page); // Wait for page to fully load\n\n// Always evaluate state at the end\nconst title = await page.title();\nconst url = page.url();\nconsole.log({ title, url });\n\n// Disconnect so the script exits (page stays alive on the server)\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Small scripts**: Each script should do ONE thing (navigate, click, fill, check)\n2. **Evaluate state**: Always log/return state at the end to decide next steps\n3. **Use page names**: Use descriptive names like `\"checkout\"`, `\"login\"`, `\"search-results\"`\n4. **Disconnect to exit**: Call `await client.disconnect()` at the end of your script so the process exits cleanly. Pages persist on the server.\n5. **Plain JS in evaluate**: Always use plain JavaScript inside `page.evaluate()` callbacks—never TypeScript. The code runs in the browser which doesn't understand TS syntax.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **tsx runs without type-checking**: Scripts run with `npx tsx` which transpiles TypeScript but does NOT type-check. Type errors won't prevent execution—they're just ignored.\n- **No TypeScript in browser context**: Code passed to `page.evaluate()`, `page.evaluateHandle()`, or similar methods runs in the browser. Use plain JavaScript only:\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Correct: plain JavaScript in evaluate\nconst text = await page.evaluate(() => {\n  return document.body.innerText;\n});\n\n// ❌ Wrong: TypeScript syntax in evaluate (will fail at runtime)\nconst text = await page.evaluate(() => {\n  const el: HTMLElement = document.body; // TS syntax - don't do this!\n  return el.innerText;\n});\n```\n\n- Names that you give to pages should be descriptive and unique\n\n❌ client.page(\"main\")\n✅ client.page(\"cnn-homepage\")\n\n## Workflow Loop\n\nFollow this pattern for complex tasks:\n\n1. **Write a script** to perform one action\n2. **Run it** and observe the output\n3. **Evaluate** - did it work? What's the current state?\n4. **Decide** - is the task complete or do we need another script?\n5. **Repeat** until task is done\n\n## Client API\n\n```typescript\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"name\"); // Get or create named page\nconst pages = await client.list(); // List all page names\nawait client.close(\"name\"); // Close a page\nawait client.disconnect(); // Disconnect (pages persist)\n\n// ARIA Snapshot methods for element discovery and interaction\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"name\"); // Get ARIA accessibility tree\nconst element = await client.selectSnapshotRef(\"name\", \"e5\"); // Get element by ref\n```\n\nThe `page` object is a standard Playwright Page—use normal Playwright methods.\n\n## Waiting\n\nUse `waitForPageLoad(page)` after navigation (checks document.readyState and network idle):\n\n```typescript\nimport { waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\n// Preferred: Wait for page to fully load\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Wait for specific elements\nawait page.waitForSelector(\".results\");\n\n// Wait for specific URL\nawait page.waitForURL(\"**/success\");\n```\n\n## Inspecting Page State\n\n### Screenshots\n\nTake screenshots when you need to visually inspect the page:\n\n```typescript\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/screenshot.png\" });\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/full.png\", fullPage: true });\n```\n\n### ARIA Snapshot (Element Discovery)\n\nUse `getAISnapshot()` when you don't know the page layout and need to discover what elements are available. It returns a YAML-formatted accessibility tree with:\n\n- **Semantic roles** (button, link, textbox, heading, etc.)\n- **Accessible names** (what screen readers would announce)\n- **Element states** (checked, disabled, expanded, etc.)\n- **Stable refs** that persist across script executions\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.goto(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Get the ARIA accessibility snapshot\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"hackernews\");\nconsole.log(snapshot);\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n#### Example Output\n\nThe snapshot is YAML-formatted with semantic structure:\n\n```yaml\n- banner:\n  - link \"Hacker News\" [ref=e1]\n  - navigation:\n    - link \"new\" [ref=e2]\n    - link \"past\" [ref=e3]\n    - link \"comments\" [ref=e4]\n    - link \"ask\" [ref=e5]\n    - link \"submit\" [ref=e6]\n  - link \"login\" [ref=e7]\n- main:\n  - list:\n    - listitem:\n      - link \"Article Title Here\" [ref=e8]\n      - text: \"528 points by username 3 hours ago\"\n      - link \"328 comments\" [ref=e9]\n- contentinfo:\n  - textbox [ref=e10]\n    - /placeholder: \"Search\"\n```\n\n#### Interpreting the Snapshot\n\n- **Roles** - Semantic element types: `button`, `link`, `textbox`, `heading`, `listitem`, etc.\n- **Names** - Accessible text in quotes: `link \"Click me\"`, `button \"Submit\"`\n- **`[ref=eN]`** - Element reference for interaction. Only assigned to visible, clickable elements\n- **`[checked]`** - Checkbox/radio is checked\n- **`[disabled]`** - Element is disabled\n- **`[expanded]`** - Expandable element (details, accordion) is open\n- **`[level=N]`** - Heading level (h1=1, h2=2, etc.)\n- **`/url:`** - Link URL (shown as a property)\n- **`/placeholder:`** - Input placeholder text\n\n#### Interacting with Refs\n\nUse `selectSnapshotRef()` to get a Playwright ElementHandle for any ref:\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect, waitForPageLoad } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.goto(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\");\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\n\n// Get the snapshot to see available refs\nconst snapshot = await client.getAISnapshot(\"hackernews\");\nconsole.log(snapshot);\n// Output shows: - link \"new\" [ref=e2]\n\n// Get the element by ref and click it\nconst element = await client.selectSnapshotRef(\"hackernews\", \"e2\");\nawait element.click();\n\nawait waitForPageLoad(page);\nconsole.log(\"Navigated to:\", page.url());\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n## Debugging Tips\n\n1. **Use getAISnapshot** to see what elements are available and their refs\n2. **Take screenshots** when you need visual context\n3. **Use waitForSelector** before interacting with dynamic content\n4. **Check page.url()** to confirm navigation worked\n\n## Error Recovery\n\nIf a script fails, the page state is preserved. You can:\n\n1. Take a screenshot to see what happened\n2. Check the current URL and DOM state\n3. Write a recovery script to get back on track\n\n```bash\ncd .codex/.home/skills/dev-browser && npx tsx <<'EOF'\nimport { connect } from \"@/client.js\";\n\nconst client = await connect();\nconst page = await client.page(\"hackernews\");\n\nawait page.screenshot({ path: \"tmp/debug.png\" });\nconsole.log({\n  url: page.url(),\n  title: await page.title(),\n  bodyText: await page.textContent(\"body\").then((t) => t?.slice(0, 200)),\n});\n\nawait client.disconnect();\nEOF\n```\n\n</skill>"}]}}
