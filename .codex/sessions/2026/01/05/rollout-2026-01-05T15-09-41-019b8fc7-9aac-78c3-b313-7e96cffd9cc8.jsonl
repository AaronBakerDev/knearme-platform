The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan follows `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/PLANS.md` and must be maintained in accordance with it.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker will provide full, working API coverage for posts, analytics, and ads in addition to the existing auth, comments, and webhooks. The worker will also verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events. A user can run a deployment, execute concrete API requests for each action, and see successful responses from Meta, with tokens cached in KV and clear error handling for missing permissions or invalid inputs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 19:22Z) Reviewed existing worker structure, OAuth flow, KV usage, and current action gaps.\n- [ ] Implement webhook signature validation with `X-Hub-Signature-256` in `src/handlers/webhooks.ts`.\n- [ ] Implement posts handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement analytics handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Implement ads handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Add end-to-end curl scenarios and verify against a live Meta app.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Wrangler warns that KV namespaces are not inherited by environments, so production must explicitly bind them.\n  Evidence: `wrangler deploy --env production` warning in CLI output.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Keep OAuth flow and token cache design; use page/IG tokens for page\n  and IG endpoints, and the user token for ads endpoints.\n  Rationale: This matches the existing worker contract and reduces surface area for credential changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n- Pending: Implementation work has not started yet.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`.\n\nDefault deployments use `wrangler.toml` with no named environment and the\n`WORKER_URL` configured there. Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API. Ensure Marketing\n  API access for ads.\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, add an `ads` handler module for `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`,\n`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`, `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, and\n`get_ad_insights`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and\ncampaign IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure\nthe access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for\nwrites, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If\n`ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error.\nImplement a small mapping so `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` translate to\nstatus updates.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so these actions are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n\nMarketing API (ads):\n- List ad accounts for a user: `GET /<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>/assigned_ad_accounts`\n  with `access_token`.\n- List campaigns: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `objective` as baseline fields).\n- Create campaign: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with\n  `name`, `objective`, `status`, `special_ad_categories`, `access_token`.\n- Ad insights: `GET /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights` with `fields=...` and\n  optional `time_range={since,until}`, `level`, `time_increment`, `filtering`.\n- Campaign update/pause/resume: confirm the exact update endpoint and accepted\n  status values in the Campaign reference before implementation, then codify\n  them here.\n\nGraph API (insights):\n- Page insights: `GET /{page-id}/insights` with `metric=<metric list>`.\n- IG insights: `GET /{instagram_business_account_id}/insights` with\n  `metric=<metric list>`.\n\nAll examples should use `env.GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`) instead of hard\ncoded versions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n5. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n6. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n    # Optional after dev validation:\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"get_posts\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\"}}'\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance is achieved when:\n\n1. A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and\nwebhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors. Updated to\nalign repo path, dev setup, deployment targets, and ads token strategy.\n"}}

It handles OAuth, token\nstorage, rate limiting, caching, and webhook ingestion.\n\n## Scope\n\nImplemented today:\n- Authentication: `oauth_status`, `oauth_connect`, `oauth_verify`, `list_accounts`\n- Comments: `get_comments`, `reply_comment`, `hide_comment`, `unhide_comment`,\n  `delete_comment`, `batch_get_comments`\n- Webhooks: `GET/POST /webhook` (stores events in KV)\n\nNot implemented (actions return \"Not implemented\"):\n- Posts: `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, `schedule_post`\n- Analytics: `get_page_insights`, `get_ig_insights`\n- Ads: `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`, `create_campaign`, `update_campaign`,\n  `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, `get_ad_insights`\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- `POST /` API actions (JSON body with `{ action, params }`)\n- `GET /oauth/callback` OAuth redirect handler\n- `GET /webhook` Meta webhook verification\n- `POST /webhook` Meta webhook events\n\n## Credentials and Configuration\n\nCloudflare:\n- KV namespaces: `META_CACHE`, `META_EVENTS`, `RATE_LIMITER`\n- `wrangler.toml` bindings must match those KV IDs\n\nWorker variables (from `wrangler.toml` / Cloudflare dashboard):\n- `NODE_ENV` (development or production)\n- `GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`)\n- `WORKER_URL` (public base URL used for OAuth redirect)\n\nWorker secrets (set via `wrangler secret put`):\n- `FB_APP_ID` (Meta App ID)\n- `FB_APP_SECRET` (Meta App Secret)\n- `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (random token you choose)\n- `API_SECRET_KEY` (Bearer token for API auth in production)\n\nMeta App (developers.facebook.com):\n- App ID + App Secret\n- Products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API\n- OAuth redirect URI: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n- Webhook callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n- Required permissions (see below)\n\n## Required Meta Permissions\n\nCurrent scopes configured in code:\n- Standard: `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, `instagram_basic`, `ads_read`\n- Advanced (requires app review): `pages_manage_posts`,\n  `pages_manage_metadata`, `instagram_manage_comments`\n\nIf you later enable content publishing or ads management, the code will need:\n- `instagram_content_publish` (currently commented out)\n- `ads_management` (currently commented out)\n\n## Cloudflare Setup\n\n1. Create KV namespaces and update `wrangler.toml` if IDs differ.\n2. Set secrets:\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID`\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET`\n   - `wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - `wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY`\n3. Set `WORKER_URL` for each environment to match the deployed URL.\n4. Deploy with `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy:production`.\n\n## Meta App Setup (Manual)\n\n1. Create a Meta App (Business type is typical).\n2. Add products:\n   - Facebook Login\n   - Webhooks\n   - Instagram Graph API\n3. Configure Facebook Login:\n   - Valid OAuth Redirect URIs: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n4. Configure Webhooks:\n   - Callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Verify Token: your `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - Subscribe to fields used in this worker: `comments`, `feed`, `mentions`,\n     `reactions`\n5. Request advanced permissions (app review) for:\n   - `pages_manage_posts`\n   - `pages_manage_metadata`\n   - `instagram_manage_comments`\n6. Ensure the Instagram Business account is linked to a Facebook Page that the\n   authenticating user administers.\n\n## OAuth Connection Flow\n\n1. Call `oauth_connect` to get an authorization URL.\n2. Open the URL in a browser and grant permissions.\n3. On success, Meta redirects to `/oauth/callback` and tokens are stored in KV.\n4. Call `oauth_verify` or `list_accounts` to confirm accounts are connected.\n\n## Dev-Browser Assisted Setup (Optional)\n\nUse the dev-browser skill to automate the Meta Dashboard setup if you want a\nrepeatable flow. Do not embed usernames or passwords in scripts; log in\ninteractively.\n\n1. Start the dev-browser server:\n   - `cd /Users/aaronbaker/.codex/skills/dev-browser && ./server.sh &`\n2. Create a script in that directory and use `getAISnapshot()` to locate UI\n   elements in the Meta developer dashboard.\n3. Walk through:\n   - Creating or selecting the Meta App\n   - Enabling products (Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API)\n   - Setting OAuth Redirect URI to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n   - Setting Webhook Callback URL to `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Copying App ID and App Secret (store outside git)\n\n## Operational Notes\n\n- Production auth requires `Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>`.\n- Development accepts any Bearer token (for local testing).\n- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute per IP.\n- CORS in production is restricted to `admin.fixmybrick.ca` and related domains.\n  Update `src/utils/cors.ts` if more origins are needed.\n- Webhook POST requests are not currently signature-validated; consider adding\n  `X-Hub-Signature-256` verification with `FB_APP_SECRET` before processing.\n"}}

The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan must be maintained in accordance with `PLANS.md` at the repository root.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta developer app named “KnearMe Meta Integration” is configured, the Fix My Brick test accounts are connected, and the Cloudflare worker is deployed with the correct secrets and environment variables. You can complete OAuth, list connected accounts, and successfully call the worker for auth, comments, webhooks, and (after running the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`) posts, analytics, and ads. The setup is inventory-tracked in a local, non-git note so future work can restart without hunting for IDs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:00Z) Create and store a private inventory of the Meta app, assets, and account IDs for all Fix My Brick test accounts.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:00Z) Configure the Meta app products, OAuth redirect, and webhooks for the dev `WORKER_URL`.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:00Z) Confirm Fix My Brick Pages, IG Business accounts, and ad accounts are linked and added to app roles or testers.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:00Z) Set Cloudflare KV bindings, secrets, and deploy the worker for dev.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:00Z) Complete OAuth, confirm `list_accounts`, and validate auth/comments/webhooks on dev.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:00Z) Run the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, then validate posts, analytics, and ads endpoints end to end.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: None yet.\n  Evidence: Not observed yet.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Create a separate setup-focused ExecPlan to inventory assets and configure the Meta app and Cloudflare worker before implementing missing endpoints.\n  Rationale: Setup and permissions are prerequisites for all endpoint testing, and deserve a dedicated, repeatable guide.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Use the dev environment first and the app name “KnearMe Meta Integration,” with Fix My Brick accounts as the test set.\n  Rationale: User confirmed dev-first greenfield and specified the app name and test scope.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Do not store secrets in git; store only references to secrets in a private inventory note.\n  Rationale: App secrets and API keys must remain outside source control.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\nPending. No setup work has been executed yet.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`. The main configuration lives in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`, which defines the dev `WORKER_URL`, KV namespace bindings, and environment variables. The setup expectations are summarized in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`. The implementation gaps for posts, analytics, and ads are covered in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, which must be completed after this setup plan to make all endpoints functional.\n\nA “Meta App” is the developer application configured in the Meta Developer Dashboard. A “Facebook Page” is a business Page owned by Fix My Brick. An “Instagram Business account” is an Instagram profile linked to a Facebook Page. An “ad account” is the account that owns ad campaigns. A “Cloudflare Worker” is the deployed script in `src/worker.ts` that exposes API endpoints. A “KV namespace” is Cloudflare’s key-value storage used by the worker for tokens and caching. `WORKER_URL` is the public base URL of the worker, and `API_SECRET_KEY` is the Bearer token used to authorize requests in production.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, create a private inventory note outside the repository and record the Meta app name, App ID, product enablement state, and the full list of Fix My Brick assets (Page IDs, IG Business IDs, ad account IDs) so the setup can be repeated without re-discovery. This inventory must not include secrets, but should include where the secrets are stored.\n\nNext, configure the Meta app named “KnearMe Meta Integration.” Enable Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and Marketing API (if ads will be used). Set the OAuth redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`, configure the webhook callback at `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with the chosen verify token, and subscribe to the fields used by the worker: comments, feed, mentions, and reactions. Add the Fix My Brick test accounts to the app’s roles or testers so they can authorize in development mode.\n\nThen, ensure that all Fix My Brick Pages and Instagram Business accounts are connected and that each test user is an admin of those assets. Confirm ad account access if ads endpoints are in scope, and capture the asset IDs in the inventory note.\n\nAfter the Meta app is configured, set Cloudflare secrets and variables for the worker. Confirm or update KV namespace bindings in `wrangler.toml`, set the dev `WORKER_URL`, and deploy the worker to the dev environment. This step makes the OAuth redirect and webhook endpoint live.\n\nFinally, perform the OAuth flow to cache tokens, validate the existing auth/comments/webhooks endpoints, and then run the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to add posts, analytics, and ads endpoints. After implementation, run the end-to-end validations described below.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\nCreate a private inventory note outside git and record asset IDs and references to where secrets are stored. Use a location like `~/.knearme/meta-graph-worker-inventory.md` or another private location. The inventory should contain the app name, App ID, `WORKER_URL`, and the full list of Fix My Brick Page, IG Business, and ad account IDs. Do not store the App Secret or API keys in this file; instead, record where those secrets are stored (for example, in a password manager entry name).\n\nFrom `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`, ensure KV namespaces exist. If you need new ones, run:\n\n    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_CACHE\n    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_EVENTS\n    npx wrangler kv:namespace create RATE_LIMITER\n\nEach command prints a new ID. If new IDs are created, update the bindings in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` to match. Re-run the command only if the namespace does not exist; if it already exists, skip creation and keep the existing IDs in `wrangler.toml`.\n\nSet secrets for the worker (run each command and paste the secret when prompted):\n\n    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID\n    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET\n    npx wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN\n    npx wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY\n\nConfirm the dev `WORKER_URL` in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` matches the value you will use in the Meta app settings. If it changes, update it before deploying.\n\nDeploy the worker in dev mode from `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`:\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n\nThe output should show a published worker URL that matches `WORKER_URL`.\n\nGenerate the OAuth URL by calling the worker and open it in a browser:\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"oauth_connect\"}'\n\nExpect a JSON response containing an `auth_url`. Open that URL, authenticate as a Fix My Brick test user, and complete the consent screen. This will redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback` and cache tokens.\n\nVerify the connection by listing accounts:\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"list_accounts\"}'\n\nExpect a response with pages and linked Instagram accounts. Compare the IDs to your inventory.\n\nValidate webhooks by simulating a verification request:\n\n    curl \"<WORKER_URL>/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=<WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN>&hub.challenge=12345\"\n\nExpect the response body to be `12345`. A mismatch indicates the verify token is wrong.\n\nValidate comments endpoints using a real post ID from a Fix My Brick Page. Use the examples in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`, and confirm successful responses.\n\nAfter completing the setup, run `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to implement posts, analytics, and ads actions. Then validate each action with a real asset ID and record successful responses in your private inventory note.\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance for this setup plan is achieved when the inventory note exists and includes all Fix My Brick asset IDs, the Meta app is configured with the correct products and redirect/webhook URLs, and the worker is deployed with the correct secrets and `WORKER_URL`. The OAuth flow must succeed, `list_accounts` must return all expected Pages and Instagram accounts, and the webhook verification endpoint must echo the challenge for the configured verify token. After the implementation plan is executed, posts, analytics, and ads endpoints must return successful responses against real assets.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nThe setup steps are safe to repeat. Re-running `wrangler secret put` overwrites the secret value, which is safe if you provide the same value or intentionally rotate it. If a KV namespace ID changes, update `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` and redeploy. If OAuth fails, repeat `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow again; the worker will overwrite cached tokens. If webhook verification fails, confirm the verify token in both Meta and Cloudflare secrets, then retry.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nKeep short evidence snippets in your private inventory note, such as the `list_accounts` response and the webhook verification echo. Example structure:\n\n    Meta App: KnearMe Meta Integration\n    App ID: 123456789012345\n    WORKER_URL (dev): https://meta-graph-worker.floral-breeze-0a38.workers.dev\n    Pages: Fix My Brick - City A (ID 111...), Fix My Brick - City B (ID 222...)\n    IG Business: @fixmybrick_citya (ID 333...), @fixmybrick_cityb (ID 444...)\n    Ad accounts: act_555..., act_666...\n    Secrets stored in: 1Password entry \"KnearMe Meta Integration\"\n    list_accounts result saved: 2026-01-05\n    webhook verify echo: 12345\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nThe setup depends on the Cloudflare Worker defined by `src/worker.ts` and its configuration in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`. It assumes the existing auth and comments actions defined in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` are working and that OAuth redirects use `WORKER_URL`. The setup also depends on the Meta app being configured with Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and (for ads) Marketing API, and on the Fix My Brick test accounts having asset access. Completion of the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` is required for posts, analytics, and ads actions to be available.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial version created to inventory and configure the Meta app, assets, and Cloudflare worker before completing missing endpoint implementations.\n"}}

Treat the reader as a complete beginner to this repository: they have only the current working tree and the single ExecPlan file you provide. There is no memory of prior plans and no external context.\n\n## How to use ExecPlans and PLANS.md\n\nWhen authoring an executable specification (ExecPlan), follow PLANS.md to the letter. If it is not in your context, refresh your memory by reading the entire PLANS.md file. Be thorough in reading (and re-reading) source material to produce an accurate specification. When creating a spec, start from the skeleton and flesh it out as you do your research.\n\nWhen implementing an executable specification (ExecPlan), do not prompt the user for \"next steps\"; simply proceed to the next milestone. Keep all sections up to date, add or split entries in the list at every stopping point to affirmatively state the progress made and next steps. Resolve ambiguities autonomously, and commit frequently.\n\nWhen discussing an executable specification (ExecPlan), record decisions in a log in the spec for posterity; it should be unambiguously clear why any change to the specification was made. ExecPlans are living documents, and it should always be possible to restart from only the ExecPlan and no other work.\n\nWhen researching a design with challenging requirements or significant unknowns, use milestones to implement proof of concepts, \"toy implementations\", etc., that allow validating whether the user's proposal is feasible. Read the source code of libraries by finding or acquiring them, research deeply, and include prototypes to guide a fuller implementation.\n\n## Requirements\n\nNON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Every ExecPlan must be fully self-contained. Self-contained means that in its current form it contains all knowledge and instructions needed for a novice to succeed.\n* Every ExecPlan is a living document. Contributors are required to revise it as progress is made, as discoveries occur, and as design decisions are finalized. Each revision must remain fully self-contained.\n* Every ExecPlan must enable a complete novice to implement the feature end-to-end without prior knowledge of this repo.\n* Every ExecPlan must produce a demonstrably working behavior, not merely code changes to \"meet a definition\".\n* Every ExecPlan must define every term of art in plain language or do not use it.\n\nPurpose and intent come first. Begin by explaining, in a few sentences, why the work matters from a user's perspective: what someone can do after this change that they could not do before, and how to see it working. Then guide the reader through the exact steps to achieve that outcome, including what to edit, what to run, and what they should observe.\n\nThe agent executing your plan can list files, read files, search, run the project, and run tests. It does not know any prior context and cannot infer what you meant from earlier milestones. Repeat any assumption you rely on. Do not point to external blogs or docs; if knowledge is required, embed it in the plan itself in your own words. If an ExecPlan builds upon a prior ExecPlan and that file is checked in, incorporate it by reference. If it is not, you must include all relevant context from that plan.\n\n## Formatting\n\nFormat and envelope are simple and strict. Each ExecPlan must be one single fenced code block labeled as `md` that begins and ends with triple backticks. Do not nest additional triple-backtick code fences inside; when you need to show commands, transcripts, diffs, or code, present them as indented blocks within that single fence. Use indentation for clarity rather than code fences inside an ExecPlan to avoid prematurely closing the ExecPlan's code fence. Use two newlines after every heading, use # and ## and so on, and correct syntax for ordered and unordered lists.\n\nWhen writing an ExecPlan to a Markdown (.md) file where the content of the file is only the single ExecPlan, you should omit the triple backticks.\n\nWrite in plain prose. Prefer sentences over lists. Avoid checklists, tables, and long enumerations unless brevity would obscure meaning. Checklists are permitted only in the `Progress` section, where they are mandatory. Narrative sections must remain prose-first.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nSelf-containment and plain language are paramount. If you introduce a phrase that is not ordinary English (\"daemon\", \"middleware\", \"RPC gateway\", \"filter graph\"), define it immediately and remind the reader how it manifests in this repository (for example, by naming the files or commands where it appears). Do not say \"as defined previously\" or \"according to the architecture doc.\" Include the needed explanation here, even if you repeat yourself.\n\nAvoid common failure modes. Do not rely on undefined jargon. Do not describe \"the letter of a feature\" so narrowly that the resulting code compiles but does nothing meaningful. Do not outsource key decisions to the reader. When ambiguity exists, resolve it in the plan itself and explain why you chose that path. Err on the side of over-explaining user-visible effects and under-specifying incidental implementation details.\n\nAnchor the plan with observable outcomes. State what the user can do after implementation, the commands to run, and the outputs they should see. Acceptance should be phrased as behavior a human can verify (\"after starting the server, navigating to http://localhost:8080/health returns HTTP 200 with body OK\") rather than internal attributes (\"added a HealthCheck struct\"). If a change is internal, explain how its impact can still be demonstrated (for example, by running tests that fail before and pass after, and by showing a scenario that uses the new behavior).\n\nSpecify repository context explicitly. Name files with full repository-relative paths, name functions and modules precisely, and describe where new files should be created. If touching multiple areas, include a short orientation paragraph that explains how those parts fit together so a novice can navigate confidently. When running commands, show the working directory and exact command line. When outcomes depend on environment, state the assumptions and provide alternatives when reasonable.\n\nBe idempotent and safe. Write the steps so they can be run multiple times without causing damage or drift. If a step can fail halfway, include how to retry or adapt. If a migration or destructive operation is necessary, spell out backups or safe fallbacks. Prefer additive, testable changes that can be validated as you go.\n\nValidation is not optional. Include instructions to run tests, to start the system if applicable, and to observe it doing something useful. Describe comprehensive testing for any new features or capabilities. Include expected outputs and error messages so a novice can tell success from failure. Where possible, show how to prove that the change is effective beyond compilation (for example, through a small end-to-end scenario, a CLI invocation, or an HTTP request/response transcript). State the exact test commands appropriate to the project's toolchain and how to interpret their results.\n\nCapture evidence. When your steps produce terminal output, short diffs, or logs, include them inside the single fenced block as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success. If you need to include a patch, prefer file-scoped diffs or small excerpts that a reader can recreate by following your instructions rather than pasting large blobs.\n\n## Milestones\n\nMilestones are narrative, not bureaucracy. If you break the work into milestones, introduce each with a brief paragraph that describes the scope, what will exist at the end of the milestone that did not exist before, the commands to run, and the acceptance you expect to observe. Keep it readable as a story: goal, work, result, proof. Progress and milestones are distinct: milestones tell the story, progress tracks granular work. Both must exist. Never abbreviate a milestone merely for the sake of brevity, do not leave out details that could be crucial to a future implementation.\n\nEach milestone must be independently verifiable and incrementally implement the overall goal of the execution plan.\n\n## Living plans and design decisions\n\n* ExecPlans are living documents. As you make key design decisions, update the plan to record both the decision and the thinking behind it. Record all decisions in the `Decision Log` section.\n* ExecPlans must contain and maintain a `Progress` section, a `Surprises & Discoveries` section, a `Decision Log`, and an `Outcomes & Retrospective` section. These are not optional.\n* When you discover optimizer behavior, performance tradeoffs, unexpected bugs, or inverse/unapply semantics that shaped your approach, capture those observations in the `Surprises & Discoveries` section with short evidence snippets (test output is ideal).\n* If you change course mid-implementation, document why in the `Decision Log` and reflect the implications in `Progress`. Plans are guides for the next contributor as much as checklists for you.\n* At completion of a major task or the full plan, write an `Outcomes & Retrospective` entry summarizing what was achieved, what remains, and lessons learned.\n\n# Prototyping milestones and parallel implementations\n\nIt is acceptable -- and often encouraged -- to include explicit prototyping milestones when they de-risk a larger change. Examples: adding a low-level operator to a dependency to validate feasibility, or exploring two composition orders while measuring optimizer effects. Keep prototypes additive and testable. Clearly label the scope as \"prototyping\"; describe how to run and observe results; and state the criteria for promoting or discarding the prototype.\n\nPrefer additive code changes followed by subtractions that keep tests passing. Parallel implementations (e.g., keeping an adapter alongside an older path during migration) are fine when they reduce risk or enable tests to continue passing during a large migration. Describe how to validate both paths and how to retire one safely with tests. When working with multiple new libraries or feature areas, consider creating spikes that evaluate the feasibility of these features independently of one another, proving that the external library performs as expected and implements the features we need in isolation.\n\n## Skeleton of a Good ExecPlan\n\n```md\n# <Short, action-oriented description>\n\nThis ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nIf PLANS.md file is checked into the repo, reference the path to that file here from the repository root and note that this document must be maintained in accordance with PLANS.md.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nExplain in a few sentences what someone gains after this change and how they can see it working. State the user-visible behavior you will enable.\n\n## Progress\n\nUse a list with checkboxes to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here, even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two (\"done\" vs. \"remaining\"). This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.\n\n- [x] (2025-10-01 13:00Z) Example completed step.\n- [ ] Example incomplete step.\n- [ ] Example partially completed step (completed: X; remaining: Y).\n\nUse timestamps to measure rates of progress.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\nDocument unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during implementation. Provide concise evidence.\n\n- Observation: ...\n  Evidence: ...\n\n## Decision Log\n\nRecord every decision made while working on the plan in the format:\n\n- Decision: ...\n  Rationale: ...\n  Date/Author: ...\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\nSummarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned at major milestones or at completion. Compare the result against the original purpose.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nDescribe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name the key files and modules by full path. Define any non-obvious term you will use. Do not refer to prior plans.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nDescribe, in prose, the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location (function, module) and what to insert or change. Keep it concrete and minimal.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\nState the exact commands to run and where to run them (working directory). When a command generates output, show a short expected transcript so the reader can compare. This section must be updated as work proceeds.\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nDescribe how to start or exercise the system and what to observe. Phrase acceptance as behavior, with specific inputs and outputs. If tests are involved, say \"run <project's test command> and expect <N> passed; the new test <name> fails before the change and passes after\".\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nIf steps can be repeated safely, say so. If a step is risky, provide a safe retry or rollback path. Keep the environment clean after completion.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nInclude the most important transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success.\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nBe prescriptive. Name the libraries, modules, and services to use and why. Specify the types, traits/interfaces, and function signatures that must exist at the end of the milestone. Prefer stable names and paths such as `crate::module::function` or `package.submodule.Interface`. E.g.:\n\nIn crates/foo/planner.rs, define:\n\n    pub trait Planner {\n        fn plan(&self, observed: &Observed) -> Vec<Action>;\n    }\n```\n\nIf you follow the guidance above, a single, stateless agent -- or a human novice -- can read your ExecPlan from top to bottom and produce a working, observable result. That is the bar: SELF-CONTAINED, SELF-SUFFICIENT, NOVICE-GUIDING, OUTCOME-FOCUSED.\n\nWhen you revise a plan, you must ensure your changes are comprehensively reflected across all sections, including the living document sections, and you must write a note at the bottom of the plan describing the change and the reason why. ExecPlans must describe not just the what but the why for almost everything.\n"}}

The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n+\n+This plan must be maintained in accordance with `PLANS.md` at the repository root.\n+\n+## Purpose / Big Picture\n+\n+After completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker can publish and schedule Facebook Page posts and publish Instagram Business content across the common formats that Meta’s APIs allow. A caller can create Page feed posts (text, link, photo, video, and multi-photo), schedule Page posts where the API supports scheduling, and publish Instagram feed posts, carousels, reels, and stories. The user-visible proof is that curl requests to the worker return success responses, and the new posts appear in the Page feed or Instagram profile/story, with container status checks returning `FINISHED` before publishing for IG videos and reels.\n+\n+## Progress\n+\n+- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Confirm the Facebook Page and Instagram Business publishing scope and finalize the action/parameter contract for the worker.\n+- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Extend OAuth scopes and request types for Instagram publishing and Facebook multi-media posts.\n+- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Implement Facebook Page multi-photo and scheduled media publishing enhancements in `src/handlers/posts.ts`.\n+- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Implement Instagram media container creation, status checks, and publishing handlers, then wire them into `src/worker.ts`.\n+- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Update docs and validate all new actions with real Page and IG Business assets.\n+\n+## Surprises & Discoveries\n+\n+- Observation: None yet.\n+  Evidence: Not observed yet.\n+\n+## Decision Log\n+\n+- Decision: Use explicit Instagram publishing actions that mirror the required container lifecycle (create, status, publish) instead of forcing a long-running, single request.\n+  Rationale: Instagram videos, reels, and carousels require asynchronous processing; separating creation and publish avoids Worker timeouts while keeping the flow explicit for callers.\n+  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n+- Decision: Treat Instagram scheduling as out of scope unless a supported API parameter is confirmed during validation.\n+  Rationale: The Instagram Graph content publishing flow does not guarantee scheduled publishing; we will not invent unsupported behavior.\n+  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n+\n+## Outcomes & Retrospective\n+\n+Pending. Implementation work has not started yet.\n+\n+## Context and Orientation\n+\n+The Meta Graph Worker lives at `integrations/meta-graph-worker`. It is a Cloudflare Worker that receives JSON actions at `POST /` and routes them in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/worker.ts`. Facebook Page publishing handlers are in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/posts.ts`. OAuth scopes are declared in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. All action names and request parameter shapes are defined in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`. Documentation of current capabilities is in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`.\n+\n+A “Facebook Page post” in this plan means a post that appears in a Page’s feed and is created through the Graph API with a Page access token. An “Instagram Business post” means a feed post, carousel, reel, or story published via the Instagram Graph API. An “Instagram media container” is a temporary object created by the API that represents the media to be published; the container must reach a `FINISHED` status before it can be published. A “carousel” is a multi-image or multi-video post composed of child media items.\n+\n+This plan focuses only on publishing actions. Comment replies, hiding, and deletion are already implemented in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/comments.ts` and are not modified here. Ads and analytics work remain covered by `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`.\n+\n+## Plan of Work\n+\n+Start by defining the publishing scope and the action contract in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`. Add Instagram publishing actions to `MetaAction` and add a new `InstagramPostContent` interface to describe IG content inputs. Extend `MetaRequestParams` with `ig_post`, `creation_id`, and any IG-specific fields required for reels, stories, and carousels. Extend `PostContent` for Facebook to include `photo_urls` (multiple images) so callers can request a multi-photo feed post. Keep all new fields optional and validate them explicitly in handlers to produce human-readable errors when required parameters are missing.\n+\n+Update OAuth scopes in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/auth/meta-auth.ts` by enabling `instagram_content_publish` (and ensuring `pages_manage_posts` remains included) so IG publishing is authorized after app review. Document the new scope requirements in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` so operators understand which permissions are needed for publishing.\n+\n+Enhance Facebook Page publishing in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/posts.ts`. Add support for multi-photo posts by uploading each photo with `published=false` to `/{page_id}/photos`, collecting the returned `id` values, and then creating a feed post with `attached_media[0]=...` JSON objects that reference the photo IDs. Add scheduling support for media posts where the API accepts `scheduled_publish_time` combined with `published=false` on the photo or video upload. If the API rejects scheduled media for the Page, return a clear error message that explains the limitation and suggests using text/link scheduling instead. Keep existing single-photo and single-video paths intact for backward compatibility.\n+\n+Implement Instagram publishing handlers in a new module, for example `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/instagram.ts`. The handler should create media containers by calling `/{ig_account_id}/media` with the correct `media_type` and media URL fields, return the `creation_id`, expose a status check action that calls `/{creation_id}?fields=status_code,status`, and provide a publish action that calls `/{ig_account_id}/media_publish` with `creation_id`. For carousels, the handler should create each child container with `is_carousel_item=true`, then create the parent container with `media_type=CAROUSEL` and the `children` list. Reels should be created with `media_type=REELS` and `video_url`, and stories with `media_type=STORIES` and `image_url` or `video_url`. Use `getInstagramAccessToken` for all IG calls. Return `MetaResponse` objects that include the creation ID, publish result, and any status fields.\n+\n+Wire the new handlers into `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/index.ts` and add new action cases to `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/worker.ts` with parameter validation. Each new action must return the standardized `MetaResponse` shape with `success`, `data`, and `message`. Update `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` to mark the posting actions as implemented and to document the new IG publishing actions, required permissions, and parameter shapes. If this plan changes the prior assumptions in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, update the posting section there to avoid conflicting guidance.\n+\n+## Concrete Steps\n+\n+Work from the worker directory so relative paths and scripts are correct.\n+\n+    cd /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker\n+\n+Implement the code changes described above in these files: `src/types/index.ts`, `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`, `src/handlers/posts.ts`, the new `src/handlers/instagram.ts`, `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `docs/README.md`.\n+\n+Run linting if available and deploy to the dev worker:\n+\n+    npm run lint\n+    npm run deploy\n+\n+Use the worker endpoint to exercise each publish flow. Replace placeholders with real IDs and URLs.\n+\n+    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n+      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n+      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n+      -d '{\"action\":\"create_post\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\",\"post\":{\"message\":\"Hello FB\"}}}'\n+\n+    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n+      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n+      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n+      -d '{\"action\":\"create_post\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\",\"post\":{\"photo_urls\":[\"<PHOTO_URL_1>\",\"<PHOTO_URL_2>\"],\"message\":\"Album test\"}}}'\n+\n+    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n+      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n+      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n+      -d '{\"action\":\"create_ig_media\",\"params\":{\"ig_account_id\":\"<IG_ID>\",\"ig_post\":{\"media_type\":\"IMAGE\",\"image_url\":\"<IMAGE_URL>\",\"caption\":\"IG feed test\"}}}'\n+\n+    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n+      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n+      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n+      -d '{\"action\":\"get_ig_media_status\",\"params\":{\"creation_id\":\"<CREATION_ID>\"}}'\n+\n+    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n+      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n+      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n+      -d '{\"action\":\"publish_ig_media\",\"params\":{\"ig_account_id\":\"<IG_ID>\",\"creation_id\":\"<CREATION_ID>\"}}'\n+\n+## Validation and Acceptance\n+\n+Acceptance requires that a Page feed post, a Page multi-photo post, an Instagram feed post, an Instagram carousel, an Instagram reel, and an Instagram story can be created through the worker and are visible in the corresponding Page or IG account. For Instagram video and reel content, `get_ig_media_status` must return a status indicating processing completion before publishing, and `publish_ig_media` must return success with a media ID. For Facebook scheduling, a scheduled post must show a future `scheduled_publish_time` and appear in the Page’s scheduled posts list; if the API does not allow scheduled media uploads, the worker must return an explicit error explaining the limitation. Each action should return a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` and a clear message on success, and a human-readable error on missing parameters or permissions.\n+\n+## Idempotence and Recovery\n+\n+These changes are additive and can be applied repeatedly without destructive effects. If an IG container is created but not yet published, re-run the status check until it is ready and then publish; if a publish call fails, re-run it with the same `creation_id`. If a multi-photo upload fails mid-way, re-run the request with the same photo URLs and let the handler upload fresh unpublished photos. If OAuth permissions are missing, re-run the OAuth flow after updating the scopes and retry the publish action.\n+\n+## Artifacts and Notes\n+\n+Keep short, redacted curl transcripts for each posting type in a private note. Example snippets:\n+\n+    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"id\":\"1234567890\"},\"message\":\"Post created successfully\"}\n+    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"creation_id\":\"1790...\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media container created\"}\n+    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"status_code\":\"FINISHED\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media status retrieved\"}\n+    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"id\":\"1790...\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media published successfully\"}\n+\n+## Interfaces and Dependencies\n+\n+In `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`, extend `MetaAction` and `MetaRequestParams` to include Instagram publishing actions and fields.

The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan follows `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/PLANS.md` and must be maintained in accordance with it.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker will provide full, working API coverage for posts, analytics, and ads in addition to the existing auth, comments, and webhooks. The worker will also verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events. A user can run a deployment, execute concrete API requests for each action, and see successful responses from Meta, with tokens cached in KV and clear error handling for missing permissions or invalid inputs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 19:22Z) Reviewed existing worker structure, OAuth flow, KV usage, and current action gaps.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement webhook signature validation with `X-Hub-Signature-256` in `src/handlers/webhooks.ts`.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement posts handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement analytics handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement ads handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [ ] Add end-to-end curl scenarios and verify against a live Meta app.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Wrangler warns that KV namespaces are not inherited by environments, so production must explicitly bind them.\n  Evidence: `wrangler deploy --env production` warning in CLI output.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Keep OAuth flow and token cache design; use page/IG tokens for page\n  and IG endpoints, and the user token for ads endpoints.\n  Rationale: This matches the existing worker contract and reduces surface area for credential changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n- Pending: Implementation work has not started yet.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`.\n\nDefault deployments use `wrangler.toml` with no named environment and the\n`WORKER_URL` configured there. Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API. Ensure Marketing\n  API access for ads.\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, add an `ads` handler module for `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`,\n`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`, `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, and\n`get_ad_insights`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and\ncampaign IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure\nthe access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for\nwrites, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If\n`ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error.\nImplement a small mapping so `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` translate to\nstatus updates.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so these actions are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n\nMarketing API (ads):\n- List ad accounts for a user: `GET /<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>/assigned_ad_accounts`\n  with `access_token`.\n- List campaigns: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `objective` as baseline fields).\n- Create campaign: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with\n  `name`, `objective`, `status`, `special_ad_categories`, `access_token`.\n- Ad insights: `GET /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights` with `fields=...` and\n  optional `time_range={since,until}`, `level`, `time_increment`, `filtering`.\n- Campaign update/pause/resume: confirm the exact update endpoint and accepted\n  status values in the Campaign reference before implementation, then codify\n  them here.\n\nGraph API (insights):\n- Page insights: `GET /{page-id}/insights` with `metric=<metric list>`.\n- IG insights: `GET /{instagram_business_account_id}/insights` with\n  `metric=<metric list>`.\n\nAll examples should use `env.GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`) instead of hard\ncoded versions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n5. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n6. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n    # Optional after dev validation:\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"get_posts\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\"}}'\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance is achieved when:\n\n1. A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and\nwebhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors. Updated to\nalign repo path, dev setup, deployment targets, and ads token strategy.\n"}}

Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Create `src/handlers/ads.ts` implementing ad account and campaign operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` if new parameter fields are needed.\n\n5. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n6. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n    # Optional after dev validation:\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n"}}

For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, extend the existing `ads` handler module to include ad sets, ads, ad creatives, and ad image uploads in addition to campaign operations. Add actions for `get_adsets`, `create_adset`, `update_adset`, `pause_adset`, `resume_adset`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `create_ad_creative`, and `upload_ad_image`. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and entity IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure the access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for writes, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If `ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error. For ad creatives, support promoting an existing Page post via `object_story_id` and a link-based creative using an `image_hash` from `upload_ad_image`. Extend `get_ad_insights` to accept `level` and `filtering` parameters so callers can request ad set or ad-level insights.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so the expanded ads actions and new request parameters are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n\nMarketing API (ads):\n- List ad accounts for a user: `GET /<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>/assigned_ad_accounts`\n  with `access_token`.\n- List campaigns: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `objective` as baseline fields).\n- Create campaign: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with\n  `name`, `objective`, `status`, `special_ad_categories`, `access_token`.\n- Ad insights: `GET /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights` with `fields=...` and\n  optional `time_range={since,until}`, `level`, `time_increment`, `filtering`.\n- Campaign update/pause/resume: confirm the exact update endpoint and accepted\n  status values in the Campaign reference before implementation, then codify\n  them here.\n\nGraph API (insights):\n- Page insights: `GET /{page-id}/insights` with `metric=<metric list>`.\n- IG insights: `GET /{instagram_business_account_id}/insights` with\n  `metric=<metric list>`.\n\nAll examples should use `env.GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`) instead of hard\ncoded versions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n"}}

A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial ExecPlan created to cover missing worker actions and\nwebhook security, based on current repo state and required behaviors. Updated to\nalign repo path, dev setup, deployment targets, and ads token strategy.\n"}}

Use `status` to start paused by default.\n- List ads: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `adset_id`, `creative{id}`).\n- Create ad: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads` with `name`, `adset_id`,\n  `creative` (with `creative_id`), and `status`.\n- Upload ad image: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adimages` with `url` to obtain\n  an `image_hash` for creative link data.\n- Create ad creative: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives` with `name`\n  plus either `object_story_id` (promote an existing Page post) or\n  `object_story_spec` with `page_id` and `link_data` including `link`, `message`,\n  and `image_hash`.\n- Ad insights: `GET /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights` with `fields=...` and\n  optional `time_range={since,until}`, `level`, `time_increment`, `filtering`.\n- Campaign, ad set, and ad update/pause/resume: confirm the update endpoint and\n  accepted status values before implementation, then codify them here.\n\nGraph API (insights):\n- Page insights: `GET /{page-id}/insights` with `metric=<metric list>`.\n- IG insights: `GET /{instagram_business_account_id}/insights` with\n  `metric=<metric list>`.\n\nAll examples should use `env.GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`) instead of hard\ncoded versions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Extend `src/handlers/ads.ts` to implement ad account, campaign, ad set, ad,\n     ad creative, and ad image operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` with new action names and ad set/ad/creative\n     parameter fields.\n\n5. Update docs.\n"}}

A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. `get_adsets` returns ad sets, `create_adset` creates an ad set with targeting and budget, and `pause_adset`/`resume_adset` update ad set status.\n8. `upload_ad_image` returns an image hash, `create_ad_creative` returns a creative ID, and `create_ad` creates an ad tied to an ad set.\n9. `pause_ad` and `resume_ad` update ad status.\n10. `get_ad_insights` supports `level=adset` and `level=ad` with optional filtering by IDs.\n11. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n"}}

It handles OAuth, token\nstorage, rate limiting, caching, and webhook ingestion.\n\n## Scope\n\nImplemented:\n- Authentication: `oauth_status`, `oauth_connect`, `oauth_verify`, `list_accounts`\n- Comments: `get_comments`, `reply_comment`, `hide_comment`, `unhide_comment`,\n  `delete_comment`, `batch_get_comments`\n- Posts: `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, `schedule_post`\n- Analytics: `get_page_insights`, `get_ig_insights`\n- Ads: `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`, `create_campaign`, `update_campaign`,\n  `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, `get_ad_insights`, `get_ad_sets`,\n  `create_ad_set`, `update_ad_set`, `pause_ad_set`, `resume_ad_set`, `get_ads`,\n  `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`,\n  `create_ad_creative`, `upload_ad_image`\n- Webhooks: `GET/POST /webhook` (stores events in KV, signature validation enabled)\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- `POST /` API actions (JSON body with `{ action, params }`)\n- `GET /oauth/callback` OAuth redirect handler\n- `GET /webhook` Meta webhook verification\n- `POST /webhook` Meta webhook events\n\n## Ads Notes\n\n- `list_ad_accounts` requires `business_scoped_user_id` in params.\n- `ad_account_id` should use the `act_<ID>` format for campaigns/insights.\n- `ad_set_id` is required for `update_ad_set`; `ad_id` is required for `update_ad`.\n- `create_ad_creative` and `upload_ad_image` require `ads_management`.\n- `get_ad_insights` supports `level`, `date_preset`, `time_increment`, `filtering`,\n  `breakdowns`, `summary`, and `sort`.\n\n## Credentials and Configuration\n\nCloudflare:\n- KV namespaces: `META_CACHE`, `META_EVENTS`, `RATE_LIMITER`\n- `wrangler.toml` bindings must match those KV IDs\n\nWorker variables (from `wrangler.toml` / Cloudflare dashboard):\n- `NODE_ENV` (development or production)\n- `GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`)\n- `WORKER_URL` (public base URL used for OAuth redirect)\n\nWorker secrets (set via `wrangler secret put`):\n- `FB_APP_ID` (Meta App ID)\n- `FB_APP_SECRET` (Meta App Secret)\n- `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (random token you choose)\n- `API_SECRET_KEY` (Bearer token for API auth in production)\n\nMeta App (developers.facebook.com):\n- App ID + App Secret\n- Products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, Marketing API (ads)\n- OAuth redirect URI: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n- Webhook callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n- Required permissions (see below)\n\n## Required Meta Permissions\n\nCurrent scopes configured in code:\n- Standard: `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, `instagram_basic`, `ads_read`\n- Advanced (requires app review): `pages_manage_posts`,\n  `pages_manage_metadata`, `instagram_manage_comments`\n\nAdditional permissions for write actions:\n- `instagram_content_publish` (if publishing IG content)\n- `ads_management` (required for create/update/pause/resume campaign actions)\n\n## Cloudflare Setup\n\n1. Create KV namespaces and update `wrangler.toml` if IDs differ.\n2. Set secrets:\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID`\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET`\n   - `wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - `wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY`\n3. Set `WORKER_URL` for each environment to match the deployed URL.\n4. Deploy with `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy:production`.\n\n## Meta App Setup (Manual)\n\n1. Create a Meta App (Business type is typical).\n2. Add products:\n   - Facebook Login\n   - Webhooks\n   - Instagram Graph API\n   - Marketing API (ads)\n3. Configure Facebook Login:\n   - Valid OAuth Redirect URIs: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n4. Configure Webhooks:\n   - Callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Verify Token: your `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - Subscribe to fields used in this worker: `comments`, `feed`, `mentions`,\n     `reactions`\n5. Request advanced permissions (app review) for:\n   - `pages_manage_posts`\n   - `pages_manage_metadata`\n   - `instagram_manage_comments`\n6. Ensure the Instagram Business account is linked to a Facebook Page that the\n   authenticating user administers.\n\n## OAuth Connection Flow\n\n1. Call `oauth_connect` to get an authorization URL.\n2. Open the URL in a browser and grant permissions.\n3. On success, Meta redirects to `/oauth/callback` and tokens are stored in KV.\n4. Call `oauth_verify` or `list_accounts` to confirm accounts are connected.\n\n## Dev-Browser Assisted Setup (Optional)\n\nUse the dev-browser skill to automate the Meta Dashboard setup if you want a\nrepeatable flow. Do not embed usernames or passwords in scripts; log in\ninteractively.\n\n1. Start the dev-browser server:\n   - `cd /Users/aaronbaker/.codex/skills/dev-browser && ./server.sh &`\n"}}

This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\n"}}

Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Extend `src/handlers/ads.ts` to implement ad account, campaign, ad set, ad,\n     ad creative, and ad image operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Add tests (TDD).\n   - Add Vitest configuration and scripts.\n   - Write unit tests for posts, analytics, ads, and webhook signature validation.\n\n5. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` with new action names and ad set/ad/creative\n     parameter fields.\n\n6. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n7. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n"}}

A webhook POST with a valid `X-Hub-Signature-256` is accepted (HTTP 200), and an invalid signature returns HTTP 403.\n2. `get_posts` returns a list of posts for a Page ID.\n3. `create_post` creates a new post when `pages_manage_posts` is granted.\n4. `get_page_insights` and `get_ig_insights` return metrics when valid IDs and metrics are provided.\n5. `list_ad_accounts` returns ad accounts, and `get_campaigns` returns campaigns.\n6. `pause_campaign` and `resume_campaign` update campaign status.\n7. `get_ad_sets` returns ad sets, `create_ad_set` creates an ad set with targeting and budget, and `pause_ad_set`/`resume_ad_set` update ad set status.\n8. `upload_ad_image` returns an image hash, `create_ad_creative` returns a creative ID, and `create_ad` creates an ad tied to an ad set.\n9. `pause_ad` and `resume_ad` update ad status.\n10. `get_ad_insights` supports `level=adset` and `level=ad` with optional filtering by IDs.\n11. Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n"}}

Each action returns a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` on a correct call and a clear error message on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nAll code changes are additive and can be reapplied safely. If any step fails, re-run the command after fixing the specific issue. Webhook signature validation can be toggled for debugging by temporarily allowing a development bypass and then removing it before release. If deploy fails, rerun `npx wrangler deploy` (dev) or `npx wrangler deploy --env production` after correcting configuration or credentials.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nRecord short curl transcripts for each action as evidence of successful responses. Keep them concise and redact tokens:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{...},\"message\":\"Posts retrieved successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nUse existing Graph API access patterns in `src/handlers/comments.ts` as a reference. All new handlers must accept `(env: Env, ...)` and return `Promise<MetaResponse>`. Any new helper functions should live in `src/utils/` and be imported explicitly. All new handlers should use `getGraphApiUrl(env.GRAPH_API_VERSION)` from `src/types/index.ts` for consistency. Any new parameters should be added to `MetaRequestParams` in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\nExtend `MetaAction` in `src/types/index.ts` with ads lifecycle actions: `get_ad_sets`, `create_ad_set`, `update_ad_set`, `pause_ad_set`, `resume_ad_set`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `create_ad_creative`, and `upload_ad_image`. Add `ad_set_id`, `adset_id` (alias), `ad_id`, `ad_set`, `adset` (alias), `ad`, `ad_creative`, `creative` (alias), `image_url`, `level`, and `filtering` fields to `MetaRequestParams` so ads requests can carry the required payloads.\n\nDefine new interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`:\n\n    export interface AdSetContent {\n      name: string;\n      campaign_id: string;\n      billing_event: string;\n      optimization_goal: string;\n      daily_budget?: number;\n      lifetime_budget?: number;\n      start_time?: string;\n      end_time?: string;\n      status?: 'ACTIVE' | 'PAUSED';\n      targeting: {\n        geo_locations: {\n          countries?: string[];\n          regions?: { key: string }[];\n          cities?: { key: string }[];\n        };\n        age_min?: number;\n        age_max?: number;\n        genders?: number[];\n      };\n    }\n\n    export interface AdCreativeContent {\n      name: string;\n      page_id?: string;\n      object_story_id?: string;\n      link_data?: {\n        link: string;\n        message?: string;\n        image_hash?: string;\n      };\n    }\n\n    export interface AdContent {\n      name: string;\n      adset_id: string;\n      creative_id: string;\n      status?: 'ACTIVE' | 'PAUSED';\n"}}

Each top‑level folder is a self‑contained project with its own `package.json`, tooling, and (in some cases) its own git history. Always `cd` into the project you’re changing and follow any nested `AGENTS.md` there.\n\n## ExecPlans\nWhen writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `PLANS.md` at the repository root) from design to implementation. Start from `EXECPLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and keep the plan updated as a living document.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `knearme-portfolio/` – Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio/app. Source in `src/`, routes in `src/app/`, public assets in `public/`.\n- `directory-platforms/` – directory platform variants:\n  - `astro-main/` (Astro + Cloudflare Pages), `v4/` (Vite + Express + Drizzle), `supabase/` (React/Vite client + Express server).\n- `rank-tracking/` – pnpm/Turborepo monorepo for rank‑tracking tools (`local-beacon/`, `next-tracker/`).\n- `docs/` – product and business documentation; treat as source‑of‑truth for decisions.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nRun from the relevant subproject:\n- `npm install` or `pnpm install` – install dependencies.\n- `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev` – start local dev server (Next.js, Astro, or Turbo apps).\n- `npm run build` / `pnpm build` – production build.\n- `npm run lint` / `pnpm lint` – ESLint/Turbo linting.\n- Where configured: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:e2e` (Jest/Playwright).\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- TypeScript-first; React components in `PascalCase`, utilities in `camelCase`.\n- Respect framework conventions (Next.js App Router, Astro pages, Express routes).\n- Formatting/linting is enforced via ESLint and (in some packages) Prettier/Turbo; run lint before pushing.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Tests are per-package: Jest or Vitest for unit tests; Playwright for e2e in `astro-main/` and `rank-tracking/`.\n- Name tests `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` and colocate under `__tests__/` or the package’s test folder.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Most packages use short, imperative commits; some follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`). Prefer Conventional Commits when unsure.\n- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and notes on how you tested. Update `docs/` and `.env.example` when behavior or config changes.\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace</cwd>\n

It handles OAuth, token\nstorage, rate limiting, caching, and webhook ingestion.\n\n## Scope\n\nImplemented:\n- Authentication: `oauth_status`, `oauth_connect`, `oauth_verify`, `list_accounts`\n- Comments: `get_comments`, `reply_comment`, `hide_comment`, `unhide_comment`,\n  `delete_comment`, `batch_get_comments`\n- Posts: `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, `schedule_post`\n- Analytics: `get_page_insights`, `get_ig_insights`\n- Ads: `list_ad_accounts`, `get_campaigns`, `create_campaign`, `update_campaign`,\n  `pause_campaign`, `resume_campaign`, `get_ad_insights`, `get_ad_sets`,\n  `create_ad_set`, `update_ad_set`, `pause_ad_set`, `resume_ad_set`, `get_ads`,\n  `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`,\n  `create_ad_creative`, `upload_ad_image`\n- Webhooks: `GET/POST /webhook` (stores events in KV, signature validation enabled)\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- `POST /` API actions (JSON body with `{ action, params }`)\n- `GET /oauth/callback` OAuth redirect handler\n- `GET /webhook` Meta webhook verification\n- `POST /webhook` Meta webhook events\n\n## Ads Notes\n\n- `list_ad_accounts` requires `business_scoped_user_id` in params.\n- `ad_account_id` should use the `act_<ID>` format for campaigns/insights.\n- `ad_set_id` is required for `update_ad_set`; `ad_id` is required for `update_ad`.\n- `create_ad_creative` and `upload_ad_image` require `ads_management`.\n- `get_ad_insights` supports `level`, `date_preset`, `time_increment`, `filtering`,\n  `breakdowns`, `summary`, and `sort`.\n\n## Credentials and Configuration\n\nCloudflare:\n- KV namespaces: `META_CACHE`, `META_EVENTS`, `RATE_LIMITER`\n- `wrangler.toml` bindings must match those KV IDs\n\nWorker variables (from `wrangler.toml` / Cloudflare dashboard):\n- `NODE_ENV` (development or production)\n- `GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`)\n- `WORKER_URL` (public base URL used for OAuth redirect)\n\nWorker secrets (set via `wrangler secret put`):\n- `FB_APP_ID` (Meta App ID)\n- `FB_APP_SECRET` (Meta App Secret)\n- `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (random token you choose)\n- `API_SECRET_KEY` (Bearer token for API auth in production)\n\nMeta App (developers.facebook.com):\n- App ID + App Secret\n- Products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, Marketing API (ads)\n- OAuth redirect URI: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n- Webhook callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n- Required permissions (see below)\n\n## Required Meta Permissions\n\nCurrent scopes configured in code:\n- Standard: `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, `instagram_basic`, `ads_read`\n- Advanced (requires app review): `pages_manage_posts`,\n  `pages_manage_metadata`, `instagram_manage_comments`\n\nAdditional permissions for write actions:\n- `instagram_content_publish` (if publishing IG content)\n- `ads_management` (required for create/update/pause/resume campaign actions)\n\n## Cloudflare Setup\n\n1. Create KV namespaces and update `wrangler.toml` if IDs differ.\n2. Set secrets:\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID`\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET`\n   - `wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - `wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY`\n3. Set `WORKER_URL` for each environment to match the deployed URL.\n4. Deploy with `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy:production`.\n\n## Meta App Setup (Manual)\n\n1. Create a Meta App (Business type is typical).\n2. Add products:\n   - Facebook Login\n   - Webhooks\n   - Instagram Graph API\n   - Marketing API (ads)\n3. Configure Facebook Login:\n   - Valid OAuth Redirect URIs: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n4. Configure Webhooks:\n   - Callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Verify Token: your `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - Subscribe to fields used in this worker: `comments`, `feed`, `mentions`,\n     `reactions`\n5. Request advanced permissions (app review) for:\n   - `pages_manage_posts`\n   - `pages_manage_metadata`\n   - `instagram_manage_comments`\n6. Ensure the Instagram Business account is linked to a Facebook Page that the\n   authenticating user administers.\n\n## OAuth Connection Flow\n\n1. Call `oauth_connect` to get an authorization URL.\n2. Open the URL in a browser and grant permissions.\n3. On success, Meta redirects to `/oauth/callback` and tokens are stored in KV.\n4. Call `oauth_verify` or `list_accounts` to confirm accounts are connected.\n\n## Dev-Browser Assisted Setup (Optional)\n\nUse the dev-browser skill to automate the Meta Dashboard setup if you want a\nrepeatable flow. Do not embed usernames or passwords in scripts; log in\ninteractively.\n\n1. Start the dev-browser server:\n   - `cd /Users/aaronbaker/.codex/skills/dev-browser && ./server.sh &`\n2.

The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan follows `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/PLANS.md` and must be maintained in accordance with it.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker will provide full, working API coverage for posts, analytics, and the ads lifecycle (ad accounts, campaigns, ad sets, ads, creatives, ad images, ad videos, deletes, and insights) in addition to the existing auth, comments, and webhooks. The worker will also verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events. A user can run a deployment, execute concrete API requests for each action, and see successful responses from Meta, with tokens cached in KV and clear error handling for missing permissions or invalid inputs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 19:22Z) Reviewed existing worker structure, OAuth flow, KV usage, and current action gaps.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement webhook signature validation with `X-Hub-Signature-256` in `src/handlers/webhooks.ts`.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement posts handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement analytics handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement ads handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Extend ads handlers to cover ad sets, ads, creatives, and ad image uploads, and add ad-level insights parameters.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:46Z) Add ads list endpoints for creatives/images, ad video uploads, and delete actions for campaigns/ad sets/ads.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Add Vitest + unit coverage for posts, analytics, ads, and webhooks (TDD flow).\n- [ ] (2026-01-05) Add end-to-end curl scenarios (including ad set/ad/creative flows) and verify against a live Meta app.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Wrangler warns that KV namespaces are not inherited by environments, so production must explicitly bind them.\n  Evidence: `wrangler deploy --env production` warning in CLI output.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Keep OAuth flow and token cache design; use page/IG tokens for page\n  and IG endpoints, and the user token for ads endpoints.\n  Rationale: This matches the existing worker contract and reduces surface area for credential changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Expand ads scope to include ad sets, ads, ad creatives, and ad image uploads, and to allow ad-level insights.\n  Rationale: Campaign-only endpoints cannot launch ads; ad set and ad creation are required for end-to-end ads management.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Add list endpoints for ad creatives and ad images, plus ad video uploads, to give agent callers full asset visibility.\n  Rationale: Agents need to enumerate existing creatives and assets, and video ads require video uploads to complete the creative flow.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Add delete actions for campaigns, ad sets, and ads, using `DELETE /{id}` with a fallback to `status=DELETED` if the API rejects deletion.\n  Rationale: Full ads lifecycle requires explicit delete/archival operations beyond pause/resume.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Use flexible `filtering` parameters for ad set and ad listing endpoints instead of limiting to single ID filters.\n  Rationale: Agents need fine-grained control (e.g., by status, campaign, name) without additional backend changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n- Pending: Handler coverage now includes posts, analytics, campaigns, ad sets, ads,\n  creatives, and ad image uploads with unit test scaffolding in place. End-to-end\n  validation against a live Meta app remains outstanding.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`.\n\nDefault deployments use `wrangler.toml` with no named environment and the\n`WORKER_URL` configured there. Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\nCampaign-level ads handlers already live in `src/handlers/ads.ts` and are wired in `src/worker.ts`. This plan extends them with ad set, ad, creative, and ad image operations, plus additional request parameters in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API. Ensure Marketing\n  API access for ads.\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, extend the existing `ads` handler module to include ad sets, ads, ad creatives, ad images, ad videos, and delete operations in addition to campaign operations. Add actions for `get_ad_sets`, `create_ad_set`, `update_ad_set`, `pause_ad_set`, `resume_ad_set`, `delete_ad_set`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `delete_ad`, `get_ad_creatives`, `create_ad_creative`, `delete_ad_creative`, `get_ad_images`, `upload_ad_image`, `upload_ad_video`, plus `delete_campaign` for campaigns. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and entity IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure the access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for writes, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If `ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error. For ad creatives, support promoting an existing Page post via `object_story_id`, a link-based creative using an `image_hash` from `upload_ad_image`, and a video creative using a `video_id` from `upload_ad_video`. Extend `get_ad_sets` and `get_ads` to accept `filtering` so callers can pass advanced filters, and extend `get_ad_insights` to accept `level` and `filtering` parameters so callers can request ad set or ad-level insights.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so the expanded ads actions and new request parameters are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## Testing Strategy (TDD)\n\nUse Vitest for unit tests. For each handler:\n\n1. Write failing tests for parameter validation and request construction.\n2. Implement or adjust handler logic to pass.\n3. Add regression tests for caching and error handling.\n\nUnit tests should mock `fetch` plus token/cache helpers and live under\n`src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`.\n\n## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n\nMarketing API (ads):\n- List ad accounts for a user: `GET /<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>/assigned_ad_accounts`\n  with `access_token`.\n- List campaigns: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `objective` as baseline fields).\n- Create campaign: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with\n  `name`, `objective`, `status`, `special_ad_categories`, `access_token`.\n- List ad sets: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `campaign_id`, `daily_budget`,\n  `lifetime_budget`, `start_time`, `end_time`).\n- Create ad set: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets` with `name`,\n  `campaign_id`, `billing_event`, `optimization_goal`, `targeting`, and either\n  `daily_budget` or `lifetime_budget`. Use `status` to start paused by default.\n- List ad creatives: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives` with `fields=...`\n  (include `id`, `name`, `object_story_spec`, `effective_object_story_id`).\n- List ad images: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adimages` with `fields=...` (include\n  `hash`, `name`, `url`).\n- List ads: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `adset_id`, `creative{id}`).\n- Create ad: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads` with `name`, `adset_id`,\n  `creative` (with `creative_id`), and `status`.\n- Upload ad image: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adimages` with `url` to obtain\n  an `image_hash` for creative link data.\n- Upload ad video: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/advideos` with `file_url`\n  (remote video URL) or `url` if the API accepts it, returning a `video_id`.\n- Create ad creative: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives` with `name`\n  plus either `object_story_id` (promote an existing Page post) or\n  `object_story_spec` with `page_id` and `link_data` including `link`, `message`,\n  and `image_hash`.\n- Ad insights: `GET /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights` with `fields=...` and\n  optional `time_range={since,until}`, `level`, `time_increment`, `filtering`.\n- Campaign, ad set, and ad update/pause/resume: confirm the update endpoint and\n  accepted status values before implementation, then codify them here.\n- Delete campaign, ad set, ad, or creative: prefer `DELETE /{id}` and fall back\n  to `POST /{id}` with `status=DELETED` if the API rejects the delete verb.\n\nGraph API (insights):\n- Page insights: `GET /{page-id}/insights` with `metric=<metric list>`.\n- IG insights: `GET /{instagram_business_account_id}/insights` with\n  `metric=<metric list>`.\n\nAll examples should use `env.GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`) instead of hard\ncoded versions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Extend `src/handlers/ads.ts` to implement ad account, campaign, ad set, ad,\n     ad creative, ad image, ad video, and delete operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Add tests (TDD).\n   - Add Vitest configuration and scripts.\n   - Write unit tests for posts, analytics, ads, and webhook signature validation.\n\n5. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` with new action names, delete actions, and ad\n     asset parameter fields (creative, image, video).\n\n6. Update docs.\n   - Extend `docs/README.md` to describe new actions, parameters, and required permissions.\n\n7. Validate.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy` from the worker directory (dev default).\n   - Run curl requests for every action and confirm expected responses.\n   - Deploy `wrangler deploy --env production` only after dev validation.\n\nExpected command examples (run from the worker directory):\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n    # Optional after dev validation:\n    npx wrangler deploy --env production\n\nExpected curl usage (replace placeholders):\n"}}

Create KV namespaces and update `wrangler.toml` if IDs differ.\n2. Set secrets:\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID`\n   - `wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET`\n   - `wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - `wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY`\n3. Set `WORKER_URL` for each environment to match the deployed URL.\n4. Deploy with `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy:production`.\n\n## Meta App Setup (Manual)\n\n1. Create a Meta App (Business type is typical).\n2. Add products:\n   - Facebook Login\n   - Webhooks\n   - Instagram Graph API\n   - Marketing API (ads)\n3. Configure Facebook Login:\n   - Valid OAuth Redirect URIs: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n4. Configure Webhooks:\n   - Callback URL: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Verify Token: your `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`\n   - Subscribe to fields used in this worker: `comments`, `feed`, `mentions`,\n     `reactions`\n5. Request advanced permissions (app review) for:\n   - `pages_manage_posts`\n   - `pages_manage_metadata`\n   - `instagram_manage_comments`\n6. Ensure the Instagram Business account is linked to a Facebook Page that the\n   authenticating user administers.\n\n## OAuth Connection Flow\n\n1. Call `oauth_connect` to get an authorization URL.\n2. Open the URL in a browser and grant permissions.\n3. On success, Meta redirects to `/oauth/callback` and tokens are stored in KV.\n4. Call `oauth_verify` or `list_accounts` to confirm accounts are connected.\n\n## Dev-Browser Assisted Setup (Optional)\n\nUse the dev-browser skill to automate the Meta Dashboard setup if you want a\nrepeatable flow. Do not embed usernames or passwords in scripts; log in\ninteractively.\n\n1. Start the dev-browser server:\n   - `cd /Users/aaronbaker/.codex/skills/dev-browser && ./server.sh &`\n2. Create a script in that directory and use `getAISnapshot()` to locate UI\n   elements in the Meta developer dashboard.\n3. Walk through:\n   - Creating or selecting the Meta App\n   - Enabling products (Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, Marketing API)\n   - Setting OAuth Redirect URI to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`\n   - Setting Webhook Callback URL to `<WORKER_URL>/webhook`\n   - Copying App ID and App Secret (store outside git)\n\n## Operational Notes\n\n- Production auth requires `Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>`.\n- Development accepts any Bearer token (for local testing).\n- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute per IP.\n- CORS in production is restricted to `admin.fixmybrick.ca` and related domains.\n  Update `src/utils/cors.ts` if more origins are needed.\n- Webhook POST requests require `X-Hub-Signature-256` and are verified using\n  `FB_APP_SECRET` before processing.\n"}}

The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan follows `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/PLANS.md` and must be maintained in accordance with it.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker will provide full, working API coverage for posts, analytics, and the ads lifecycle (ad accounts, campaigns, ad sets, ads, creatives, ad images, ad videos, deletes, and insights) in addition to the existing auth, comments, and webhooks. The worker will also verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events. A user can run a deployment, execute concrete API requests for each action, and see successful responses from Meta, with tokens cached in KV and clear error handling for missing permissions or invalid inputs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 19:22Z) Reviewed existing worker structure, OAuth flow, KV usage, and current action gaps.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement webhook signature validation with `X-Hub-Signature-256` in `src/handlers/webhooks.ts`.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement posts handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement analytics handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Implement ads handlers and wire into `src/worker.ts` actions.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Extend ads handlers to cover ad sets, ads, creatives, and ad image uploads, and add ad-level insights parameters.\n- [x] (2026-01-05 21:15Z) Add ads list endpoints for creatives/images, ad video uploads, and delete actions for campaigns/ad sets/ads.\n- [x] (2026-01-05) Add Vitest + unit coverage for posts, analytics, ads, and webhooks (TDD flow).\n- [ ] (2026-01-05) Add end-to-end curl scenarios (including ad set/ad/creative flows) and verify against a live Meta app.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Wrangler warns that KV namespaces are not inherited by environments, so production must explicitly bind them.\n  Evidence: `wrangler deploy --env production` warning in CLI output.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Keep OAuth flow and token cache design; use page/IG tokens for page\n  and IG endpoints, and the user token for ads endpoints.\n  Rationale: This matches the existing worker contract and reduces surface area for credential changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Expand ads scope to include ad sets, ads, ad creatives, and ad image uploads, and to allow ad-level insights.\n  Rationale: Campaign-only endpoints cannot launch ads; ad set and ad creation are required for end-to-end ads management.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Add list endpoints for ad creatives and ad images, plus ad video uploads, to give agent callers full asset visibility.\n  Rationale: Agents need to enumerate existing creatives and assets, and video ads require video uploads to complete the creative flow.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Add delete actions for campaigns, ad sets, and ads, using `DELETE /{id}` with a fallback to `status=DELETED` if the API rejects deletion.\n  Rationale: Full ads lifecycle requires explicit delete/archival operations beyond pause/resume.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Use flexible `filtering` parameters for ad set and ad listing endpoints instead of limiting to single ID filters.\n  Rationale: Agents need fine-grained control (e.g., by status, campaign, name) without additional backend changes.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n- Pending: Handler coverage now includes posts, analytics, campaigns, ad sets,\n  ads, creatives, ad images/videos, list endpoints, and delete actions with unit\n  test scaffolding in place. End-to-end validation against a live Meta app\n  remains outstanding.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`.\n\nDefault deployments use `wrangler.toml` with no named environment and the\n`WORKER_URL` configured there. Production uses `--env production` and the\nproduction `WORKER_URL`.\n\nThe entry point is `src/worker.ts`, which routes actions by name. Existing handlers are in `src/handlers/`, auth logic in `src/auth/`, and common helpers in `src/utils/`. The `src/types/index.ts` file declares every action and the request/response shapes. The worker caches tokens and API responses in Cloudflare KV namespaces configured by `wrangler.toml`.\n\nTokens are fetched through the OAuth flow in `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. Long-lived user tokens and page tokens are cached in KV. Instagram access uses the linked page token. The existing comments handlers use the page token for Graph API calls. The worker is meant to be called from an internal API client with a Bearer token; in production the token must match `API_SECRET_KEY`.\n\nCampaign-level ads handlers already live in `src/handlers/ads.ts` and are wired in `src/worker.ts`. This plan extends them with ad set, ad, creative, and ad image operations, plus additional request parameters in `src/types/index.ts`.\n\n## Meta Developer Setup (Dev Account)\n\nBefore implementation and validation, ensure the dev account is ready:\n\n- Create/select a Meta app (Business type is typical).\n- Add products: Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API. Ensure Marketing\n  API access for ads.\n- Configure OAuth redirect: `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`.\n- Configure Webhooks: `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and\n  subscribe to required fields (feed, comments, mentions, reactions).\n- Ensure the Page and IG Business account are connected and the app has access.\n- For ads: grant the app or a system user access to the ad account and confirm\n  `ads_read` (and `ads_management` for writes).\n- Run `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow to cache tokens.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, secure webhook ingestion by validating `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FB_APP_SECRET` and rejecting invalid payloads. This prevents spoofed events in the `META_EVENTS` KV namespace. Implement a helper to compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature and compare against the header.\n\nSecond, add a `posts` handler module that implements `get_posts`, `create_post`, `update_post`, `delete_post`, and `schedule_post`. Use the Graph API endpoints for page feed and post publishing. Reuse the existing page access token retrieval and caching. Add explicit parameter validation in the handler and friendly error messages for common permission failures.\n\nThird, add an `analytics` handler module for `get_page_insights` and\n`get_ig_insights`. For pages, use the insights endpoint with metrics passed in\n`params.metrics` and validate the metric list. For Instagram, use the IG insights\nendpoint with `ig_account_id` and confirm required permissions for insights.\nCache insights responses for the TTL defined in `src/utils/cache.ts`.\n\nFourth, extend the existing `ads` handler module to include ad sets, ads, ad creatives, ad images, ad videos, and delete operations in addition to campaign operations. Add actions for `get_ad_sets`, `create_ad_set`, `update_ad_set`, `pause_ad_set`, `resume_ad_set`, `delete_ad_set`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `delete_ad`, `get_ad_creatives`, `create_ad_creative`, `delete_ad_creative`, `get_ad_images`, `upload_ad_image`, `upload_ad_video`, plus `delete_campaign` for campaigns. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and entity IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure the access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for writes, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If `ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error. For ad creatives, support promoting an existing Page post via `object_story_id`, a link-based creative using an `image_hash` from `upload_ad_image`, and a video creative using a `video_id` from `upload_ad_video`. Extend `get_ad_sets` and `get_ads` to accept `filtering` so callers can pass advanced filters, and extend `get_ad_insights` to accept `level` and `filtering` parameters so callers can request ad set or ad-level insights.\n\nFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so the expanded ads actions and new request parameters are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n\nFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n\n## Testing Strategy (TDD)\n\nUse Vitest for unit tests. For each handler:\n\n1. Write failing tests for parameter validation and request construction.\n2. Implement or adjust handler logic to pass.\n3. Add regression tests for caching and error handling.\n\nUnit tests should mock `fetch` plus token/cache helpers and live under\n`src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`.\n\n## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n\nMarketing API (ads):\n- List ad accounts for a user: `GET /<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>/assigned_ad_accounts`\n  with `access_token`.\n- List campaigns: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `objective` as baseline fields).\n- Create campaign: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with\n  `name`, `objective`, `status`, `special_ad_categories`, `access_token`.\n- List ad sets: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `campaign_id`, `daily_budget`,\n  `lifetime_budget`, `start_time`, `end_time`).\n- Create ad set: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets` with `name`,\n  `campaign_id`, `billing_event`, `optimization_goal`, `targeting`, and either\n  `daily_budget` or `lifetime_budget`. Use `status` to start paused by default.\n- List ad creatives: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives` with `fields=...`\n  (include `id`, `name`, `object_story_spec`, `effective_object_story_id`).\n- List ad images: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adimages` with `fields=...` (include\n  `hash`, `name`, `url`).\n- List ads: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads` with `fields=...` (include\n  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `adset_id`, `creative{id}`).\n- Create ad: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/ads` with `name`, `adset_id`,\n  `creative` (with `creative_id`), and `status`.\n- Upload ad image: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adimages` with `url` to obtain\n  an `image_hash` for creative link data.\n- Upload ad video: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/advideos` with `file_url`\n  (remote video URL) or `url` if the API accepts it, returning a `video_id`.\n- Create ad creative: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives` with `name`\n  plus either `object_story_id` (promote an existing Page post) or\n  `object_story_spec` with `page_id` and `link_data` including `link`, `message`,\n  and `image_hash`.\n- Ad insights: `GET /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights` with `fields=...` and\n  optional `time_range={since,until}`, `level`, `time_increment`, `filtering`.\n- Campaign, ad set, and ad update/pause/resume: confirm the update endpoint and\n  accepted status values before implementation, then codify them here.\n- Delete campaign, ad set, ad, or creative: prefer `DELETE /{id}` and fall back\n  to `POST /{id}` with `status=DELETED` if the API rejects the delete verb.\n\nGraph API (insights):\n- Page insights: `GET /{page-id}/insights` with `metric=<metric list>`.\n- IG insights: `GET /{instagram_business_account_id}/insights` with\n  `metric=<metric list>`.\n\nAll examples should use `env.GRAPH_API_VERSION` (e.g. `v22.0`) instead of hard\ncoded versions.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\n1. Confirm Meta Developer dev-account setup (see section above) and complete\n   `oauth_connect` in the browser to cache tokens.\n\n2. Implement webhook signature validation.\n   - Edit `src/handlers/webhooks.ts` and add a signature check in `handleWebhookEvent`.\n   - Compute HMAC SHA-256 over the raw request body (clone before parsing) and\n     compare to `X-Hub-Signature-256`.\n   - If missing or invalid, log and return HTTP 403.\n\n3. Add new handlers.\n   - Create `src/handlers/posts.ts` implementing post CRUD and scheduling.\n   - Create `src/handlers/analytics.ts` implementing page and IG insights.\n   - Extend `src/handlers/ads.ts` to implement ad account, campaign, ad set, ad,\n     ad creative, ad image, ad video, and delete operations.\n   - Use the endpoints in API Reference Notes; update this plan if any endpoint\n     or required parameter differs after deeper validation.\n\n4. Add tests (TDD).\n   - Add Vitest configuration and scripts.\n   - Write unit tests for posts, analytics, ads, and webhook signature validation.\n\n5. Wire handlers into the worker.\n   - Update `src/handlers/index.ts` to export new handlers.\n   - Update `src/worker.ts` to call the handlers for each action.\n   - Update `src/types/index.ts` with new action names, delete actions, and ad\n     asset parameter fields (creative, image, video).\n\n6.

The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan must be maintained in accordance with `PLANS.md` at the repository root.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta developer app named “KnearMe Meta Integration” is configured, the Fix My Brick test accounts are connected, and the Cloudflare worker is deployed with the correct secrets and environment variables. You can complete OAuth, list connected accounts, and successfully call the worker for auth, comments, webhooks, and (after running the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`) posts, analytics, and ads. The setup is inventory-tracked in a local, non-git note so future work can restart without hunting for IDs.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] (2026-01-05 20:51Z) Create and store a private inventory of the Meta app, assets, and account IDs for all Fix My Brick test accounts.\n- [x] (2026-01-05 20:51Z) Configure the Meta app products, OAuth redirect, and webhooks for the dev `WORKER_URL`.\n- [x] (2026-01-05 20:51Z) Confirm Fix My Brick Pages, IG Business accounts, and ad accounts are linked and added to app roles or testers.\n- [x] (2026-01-05 20:51Z) Set Cloudflare KV bindings, secrets, and deploy the worker for dev.\n- [x] (2026-01-05 20:51Z) Complete OAuth, confirm `list_accounts`, and validate auth/comments/webhooks on dev.\n- [ ] (pending) Run the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, then validate posts, analytics, and ads endpoints end to end.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: Worker deployed to `aaron23baker.workers.dev` subdomain, not `floral-breeze-0a38.workers.dev` as originally configured.\n  Evidence: Wrangler deploy output showed different subdomain. Required updating wrangler.toml WORKER_URL and Meta app OAuth/webhook URLs.\n- Observation: OAuth scopes require app permissions to be configured in \"Use cases\" before they can be requested.\n  Evidence: Initial OAuth failed with \"Invalid Scopes\" error until `pages_manage_posts`, `pages_manage_metadata`, `instagram_basic`, and `instagram_manage_comments` were added via the Meta Developer Dashboard Use Cases section.\n- Observation: Instagram API has two setup paths - \"Instagram login\" and \"Facebook login\" - each with different permissions.\n  Evidence: Had to add permissions in both \"API setup with Instagram login\" and \"API setup with Facebook login\" sections to cover all use cases.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Create a separate setup-focused ExecPlan to inventory assets and configure the Meta app and Cloudflare worker before implementing missing endpoints.\n  Rationale: Setup and permissions are prerequisites for all endpoint testing, and deserve a dedicated, repeatable guide.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Use the dev environment first and the app name “KnearMe Meta Integration,” with Fix My Brick accounts as the test set.\n  Rationale: User confirmed dev-first greenfield and specified the app name and test scope.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Do not store secrets in git; store only references to secrets in a private inventory note.\n  Rationale: App secrets and API keys must remain outside source control.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n**Setup completed successfully on 2026-01-05.**\n\n### Results\n- Meta app \"KnearMe Graph Integration\" (ID: 33433788782901465) created and configured\n- Worker deployed to `https://meta-graph-worker.aaron23baker.workers.dev`\n- OAuth flow completed with 7 accounts connected (5 Pages, 2 Instagram accounts)\n- Webhook verification passed (echo test successful)\n- `list_accounts` endpoint validated and returning correct data\n\n### Connected Accounts\n| Type | Name | ID |\n|------|------|-----|\n| Page | From Brick To Stone | 198632683327221 |\n| Page | Marvellous Contracting Inc. | 105772737912215 |\n| Page | O.N.S Auto | 110159590417382 |\n| Instagram | @onsauto | 17841412282952791 |\n| Page | Let's Get Social | 102014541749740 |\n| Page | Cannifind.co | 101933907847176 |\n| Instagram | @cannifind.co | 17841422951432437 |\n\n### What Worked Well\n- Existing KV namespace IDs in wrangler.toml were valid and didn't need recreation\n- Worker code handled OAuth callback and token exchange correctly\n- Meta Business Manager integration streamlined page/Instagram access\n\n### What Could Be Improved\n- Document the correct worker subdomain earlier in the process\n- Pre-configure all necessary permissions in Meta app before starting OAuth flow\n- Create a checklist of required Use Case permissions for faster setup\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe worker lives at `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`. The main configuration lives in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`, which defines the dev `WORKER_URL`, KV namespace bindings, and environment variables. The setup expectations are summarized in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`. The implementation gaps for posts, analytics, and ads are covered in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, which must be completed after this setup plan to make all endpoints functional.\n\nA “Meta App” is the developer application configured in the Meta Developer Dashboard. A “Facebook Page” is a business Page owned by Fix My Brick. An “Instagram Business account” is an Instagram profile linked to a Facebook Page. An “ad account” is the account that owns ad campaigns. A “Cloudflare Worker” is the deployed script in `src/worker.ts` that exposes API endpoints. A “KV namespace” is Cloudflare’s key-value storage used by the worker for tokens and caching. `WORKER_URL` is the public base URL of the worker, and `API_SECRET_KEY` is the Bearer token used to authorize requests in production.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nFirst, create a private inventory note outside the repository and record the Meta app name, App ID, product enablement state, and the full list of Fix My Brick assets (Page IDs, IG Business IDs, ad account IDs) so the setup can be repeated without re-discovery. This inventory must not include secrets, but should include where the secrets are stored.\n\nNext, configure the Meta app named “KnearMe Meta Integration.” Enable Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and Marketing API (if ads will be used). Set the OAuth redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`, configure the webhook callback at `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with the chosen verify token, and subscribe to the fields used by the worker: comments, feed, mentions, and reactions. Add the Fix My Brick test accounts to the app’s roles or testers so they can authorize in development mode.\n\nThen, ensure that all Fix My Brick Pages and Instagram Business accounts are connected and that each test user is an admin of those assets. Confirm ad account access if ads endpoints are in scope, and capture the asset IDs in the inventory note.\n\nAfter the Meta app is configured, set Cloudflare secrets and variables for the worker. Confirm or update KV namespace bindings in `wrangler.toml`, set the dev `WORKER_URL`, and deploy the worker to the dev environment. This step makes the OAuth redirect and webhook endpoint live.\n\nFinally, perform the OAuth flow to cache tokens, validate the existing auth/comments/webhooks endpoints, and then run the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to add posts, analytics, and ads endpoints. After implementation, run the end-to-end validations described below.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\nCreate a private inventory note outside git and record asset IDs and references to where secrets are stored. Use a location like `~/.knearme/meta-graph-worker-inventory.md` or another private location. The inventory should contain the app name, App ID, `WORKER_URL`, and the full list of Fix My Brick Page, IG Business, and ad account IDs. Do not store the App Secret or API keys in this file; instead, record where those secrets are stored (for example, in a password manager entry name).\n\nFrom `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`, ensure KV namespaces exist. If you need new ones, run:\n\n    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_CACHE\n    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_EVENTS\n    npx wrangler kv:namespace create RATE_LIMITER\n\nEach command prints a new ID. If new IDs are created, update the bindings in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` to match. Re-run the command only if the namespace does not exist; if it already exists, skip creation and keep the existing IDs in `wrangler.toml`.\n\nSet secrets for the worker (run each command and paste the secret when prompted):\n\n    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID\n    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET\n    npx wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN\n    npx wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY\n\nConfirm the dev `WORKER_URL` in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` matches the value you will use in the Meta app settings. If it changes, update it before deploying.\n\nDeploy the worker in dev mode from `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`:\n\n    npx wrangler deploy\n\nThe output should show a published worker URL that matches `WORKER_URL`.\n\nGenerate the OAuth URL by calling the worker and open it in a browser:\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"oauth_connect\"}'\n\nExpect a JSON response containing an `auth_url`. Open that URL, authenticate as a Fix My Brick test user, and complete the consent screen. This will redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback` and cache tokens.\n\nVerify the connection by listing accounts:\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"list_accounts\"}'\n\nExpect a response with pages and linked Instagram accounts. Compare the IDs to your inventory.\n\nValidate webhooks by simulating a verification request:\n\n    curl \"<WORKER_URL>/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=<WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN>&hub.challenge=12345\"\n\nExpect the response body to be `12345`. A mismatch indicates the verify token is wrong.\n\nValidate comments endpoints using a real post ID from a Fix My Brick Page. Use the examples in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`, and confirm successful responses.\n\nAfter completing the setup, run `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to implement posts, analytics, and ads actions. Then validate each action with a real asset ID and record successful responses in your private inventory note.\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance for this setup plan is achieved when the inventory note exists and includes all Fix My Brick asset IDs, the Meta app is configured with the correct products and redirect/webhook URLs, and the worker is deployed with the correct secrets and `WORKER_URL`. The OAuth flow must succeed, `list_accounts` must return all expected Pages and Instagram accounts, and the webhook verification endpoint must echo the challenge for the configured verify token. After the implementation plan is executed, posts, analytics, and ads endpoints must return successful responses against real assets.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nThe setup steps are safe to repeat. Re-running `wrangler secret put` overwrites the secret value, which is safe if you provide the same value or intentionally rotate it. If a KV namespace ID changes, update `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` and redeploy. If OAuth fails, repeat `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow again; the worker will overwrite cached tokens. If webhook verification fails, confirm the verify token in both Meta and Cloudflare secrets, then retry.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nKeep short evidence snippets in your private inventory note, such as the `list_accounts` response and the webhook verification echo. Example structure:\n\n    Meta App: KnearMe Meta Integration\n    App ID: 123456789012345\n    WORKER_URL (dev): https://meta-graph-worker.floral-breeze-0a38.workers.dev\n    Pages: Fix My Brick - City A (ID 111...), Fix My Brick - City B (ID 222...)\n    IG Business: @fixmybrick_citya (ID 333...), @fixmybrick_cityb (ID 444...)\n    Ad accounts: act_555..., act_666...\n    Secrets stored in: 1Password entry \"KnearMe Meta Integration\"\n    list_accounts result saved: 2026-01-05\n    webhook verify echo: 12345\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nThe setup depends on the Cloudflare Worker defined by `src/worker.ts` and its configuration in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`. It assumes the existing auth and comments actions defined in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` are working and that OAuth redirects use `WORKER_URL`. The setup also depends on the Meta app being configured with Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and (for ads) Marketing API, and on the Fix My Brick test accounts having asset access. Completion of the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` is required for posts, analytics, and ads actions to be available.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial version created to inventory and configure the Meta app, assets, and Cloudflare worker before completing missing endpoint implementations.\n"}}

The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\nThis plan must be maintained in accordance with `PLANS.md` at the repository root.\n\n## Purpose / Big Picture\n\nAfter completing this plan, the Meta Graph Worker can publish and schedule Facebook Page posts and publish Instagram Business content across the common formats that Meta’s APIs allow. A caller can create Page feed posts (text, link, photo, video, and multi-photo), schedule Page posts where the API supports scheduling, and publish Instagram feed posts, carousels, reels, and stories. The user-visible proof is that curl requests to the worker return success responses, and the new posts appear in the Page feed or Instagram profile/story, with container status checks returning `FINISHED` before publishing for IG videos and reels.\n\n## Progress\n\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Confirm the Facebook Page and Instagram Business publishing scope and finalize the action/parameter contract for the worker.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Extend OAuth scopes and request types for Instagram publishing and Facebook multi-media posts.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Implement Facebook Page multi-photo and scheduled media publishing enhancements in `src/handlers/posts.ts`.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Implement Instagram media container creation, status checks, and publishing handlers, then wire them into `src/worker.ts`.\n- [ ] (2026-01-05 20:18Z) Update docs and validate all new actions with real Page and IG Business assets.\n\n## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n- Observation: None yet.\n  Evidence: Not observed yet.\n\n## Decision Log\n\n- Decision: Use explicit Instagram publishing actions that mirror the required container lifecycle (create, status, publish) instead of forcing a long-running, single request.\n  Rationale: Instagram videos, reels, and carousels require asynchronous processing; separating creation and publish avoids Worker timeouts while keeping the flow explicit for callers.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n- Decision: Treat Instagram scheduling as out of scope unless a supported API parameter is confirmed during validation.\n  Rationale: The Instagram Graph content publishing flow does not guarantee scheduled publishing; we will not invent unsupported behavior.\n  Date/Author: 2026-01-05 / Codex\n\n## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\nPending. Implementation work has not started yet.\n\n## Context and Orientation\n\nThe Meta Graph Worker lives at `integrations/meta-graph-worker`. It is a Cloudflare Worker that receives JSON actions at `POST /` and routes them in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/worker.ts`. Facebook Page publishing handlers are in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/posts.ts`. OAuth scopes are declared in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/auth/meta-auth.ts`. All action names and request parameter shapes are defined in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`. Documentation of current capabilities is in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`.\n\nA “Facebook Page post” in this plan means a post that appears in a Page’s feed and is created through the Graph API with a Page access token. An “Instagram Business post” means a feed post, carousel, reel, or story published via the Instagram Graph API. An “Instagram media container” is a temporary object created by the API that represents the media to be published; the container must reach a `FINISHED` status before it can be published. A “carousel” is a multi-image or multi-video post composed of child media items.\n\nThis plan focuses only on publishing actions. Comment replies, hiding, and deletion are already implemented in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/comments.ts` and are not modified here. Ads and analytics work remain covered by `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`.\n\n## Plan of Work\n\nStart by defining the publishing scope and the action contract in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`. Add Instagram publishing actions to `MetaAction` and add a new `InstagramPostContent` interface to describe IG content inputs. Extend `MetaRequestParams` with `ig_post`, `creation_id`, and any IG-specific fields required for reels, stories, and carousels. Extend `PostContent` for Facebook to include `photo_urls` (multiple images) so callers can request a multi-photo feed post. Keep all new fields optional and validate them explicitly in handlers to produce human-readable errors when required parameters are missing.\n\nUpdate OAuth scopes in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/auth/meta-auth.ts` by enabling `instagram_content_publish` (and ensuring `pages_manage_posts` remains included) so IG publishing is authorized after app review. Document the new scope requirements in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` so operators understand which permissions are needed for publishing.\n\nEnhance Facebook Page publishing in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/posts.ts`. Add support for multi-photo posts by uploading each photo with `published=false` to `/{page_id}/photos`, collecting the returned `id` values, and then creating a feed post with `attached_media[0]=...` JSON objects that reference the photo IDs. Add scheduling support for media posts where the API accepts `scheduled_publish_time` combined with `published=false` on the photo or video upload. If the API rejects scheduled media for the Page, return a clear error message that explains the limitation and suggests using text/link scheduling instead. Keep existing single-photo and single-video paths intact for backward compatibility.\n\nImplement Instagram publishing handlers in a new module, for example `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/instagram.ts`. The handler should create media containers by calling `/{ig_account_id}/media` with the correct `media_type` and media URL fields, return the `creation_id`, expose a status check action that calls `/{creation_id}?fields=status_code,status`, and provide a publish action that calls `/{ig_account_id}/media_publish` with `creation_id`. For carousels, the handler should create each child container with `is_carousel_item=true`, then create the parent container with `media_type=CAROUSEL` and the `children` list. Reels should be created with `media_type=REELS` and `video_url`, and stories with `media_type=STORIES` and `image_url` or `video_url`. Use `getInstagramAccessToken` for all IG calls. Return `MetaResponse` objects that include the creation ID, publish result, and any status fields.\n\nWire the new handlers into `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/index.ts` and add new action cases to `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/worker.ts` with parameter validation. Each new action must return the standardized `MetaResponse` shape with `success`, `data`, and `message`. Update `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` to mark the posting actions as implemented and to document the new IG publishing actions, required permissions, and parameter shapes. If this plan changes the prior assumptions in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, update the posting section there to avoid conflicting guidance.\n\n## Concrete Steps\n\nWork from the worker directory so relative paths and scripts are correct.\n\n    cd /Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker\n\nImplement the code changes described above in these files: `src/types/index.ts`, `src/auth/meta-auth.ts`, `src/handlers/posts.ts`, the new `src/handlers/instagram.ts`, `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `docs/README.md`.\n\nRun linting if available and deploy to the dev worker:\n\n    npm run lint\n    npm run deploy\n\nUse the worker endpoint to exercise each publish flow. Replace placeholders with real IDs and URLs.\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"create_post\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\",\"post\":{\"message\":\"Hello FB\"}}}'\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"create_post\",\"params\":{\"page_id\":\"<PAGE_ID>\",\"post\":{\"photo_urls\":[\"<PHOTO_URL_1>\",\"<PHOTO_URL_2>\"],\"message\":\"Album test\"}}}'\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"create_ig_media\",\"params\":{\"ig_account_id\":\"<IG_ID>\",\"ig_post\":{\"media_type\":\"IMAGE\",\"image_url\":\"<IMAGE_URL>\",\"caption\":\"IG feed test\"}}}'\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"get_ig_media_status\",\"params\":{\"creation_id\":\"<CREATION_ID>\"}}'\n\n    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API_SECRET_KEY>\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\"action\":\"publish_ig_media\",\"params\":{\"ig_account_id\":\"<IG_ID>\",\"creation_id\":\"<CREATION_ID>\"}}'\n\n## Validation and Acceptance\n\nAcceptance requires that a Page feed post, a Page multi-photo post, an Instagram feed post, an Instagram carousel, an Instagram reel, and an Instagram story can be created through the worker and are visible in the corresponding Page or IG account. For Instagram video and reel content, `get_ig_media_status` must return a status indicating processing completion before publishing, and `publish_ig_media` must return success with a media ID. For Facebook scheduling, a scheduled post must show a future `scheduled_publish_time` and appear in the Page’s scheduled posts list; if the API does not allow scheduled media uploads, the worker must return an explicit error explaining the limitation. Each action should return a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` and a clear message on success, and a human-readable error on missing parameters or permissions.\n\n## Idempotence and Recovery\n\nThese changes are additive and can be applied repeatedly without destructive effects. If an IG container is created but not yet published, re-run the status check until it is ready and then publish; if a publish call fails, re-run it with the same `creation_id`. If a multi-photo upload fails mid-way, re-run the request with the same photo URLs and let the handler upload fresh unpublished photos. If OAuth permissions are missing, re-run the OAuth flow after updating the scopes and retry the publish action.\n\n## Artifacts and Notes\n\nKeep short, redacted curl transcripts for each posting type in a private note. Example snippets:\n\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"id\":\"1234567890\"},\"message\":\"Post created successfully\"}\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"creation_id\":\"1790...\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media container created\"}\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"status_code\":\"FINISHED\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media status retrieved\"}\n    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"id\":\"1790...\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media published successfully\"}\n\n## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\nIn `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`, extend `MetaAction` and `MetaRequestParams` to include Instagram publishing actions and fields. Add a new `InstagramPostContent` interface similar to the following, and extend `PostContent` with `photo_urls` for Facebook multi-photo posts:\n\n    export interface InstagramPostContent {\n      media_type: 'IMAGE' | 'VIDEO' | 'CAROUSEL' | 'REELS' | 'STORIES';\n      image_url?: string;\n      video_url?: string;\n      caption?: string;\n      cover_url?: string;\n      share_to_feed?: boolean;\n      thumb_offset?: number;\n      children?: { image_url?: string; video_url?: string }[];\n      location_id?: string;\n      user_tags?: { username: string; x: number; y: number }[];\n    }\n\nIn `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/handlers/instagram.ts`, define:\n\n    export async function handleCreateInstagramMedia(\n      igAccountId: string,\n      content: InstagramPostContent,\n      env: Env\n    ): Promise<MetaResponse>\n\n    export async function handleGetInstagramMediaStatus(\n      creationId: string,\n      env: Env\n    ): Promise<MetaResponse>\n\n    export async function handlePublishInstagramMedia(\n      igAccountId: string,\n      creationId: string,\n      env: Env\n    ): Promise<MetaResponse>\n\nEnsure these functions use `getInstagramAccessToken` from `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/auth/meta-auth.ts` and `getGraphApiUrl` from `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`. In `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/worker.ts`, route new actions to these handlers and validate parameters before invoking them.\n\nPlan revision notes: Initial draft created on 2026-01-05 to cover full Facebook Page and Instagram Business publishing capabilities requested by the user.\n"}}

The main configuration lives in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`, which defines the dev `WORKER_URL`, KV namespace bindings, and environment variables. The setup expectations are summarized in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`. The implementation gaps for posts, analytics, and ads are covered in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md`, which must be completed after this setup plan to make all endpoints functional.\n    76\t\n    77\tA “Meta App” is the developer application configured in the Meta Developer Dashboard. A “Facebook Page” is a business Page owned by Fix My Brick. An “Instagram Business account” is an Instagram profile linked to a Facebook Page. An “ad account” is the account that owns ad campaigns. A “Cloudflare Worker” is the deployed script in `src/worker.ts` that exposes API endpoints. A “KV namespace” is Cloudflare’s key-value storage used by the worker for tokens and caching. `WORKER_URL` is the public base URL of the worker, and `API_SECRET_KEY` is the Bearer token used to authorize requests in production.\n    78\t\n    79\t## Plan of Work\n    80\t\n    81\tFirst, create a private inventory note outside the repository and record the Meta app name, App ID, product enablement state, and the full list of Fix My Brick assets (Page IDs, IG Business IDs, ad account IDs) so the setup can be repeated without re-discovery. This inventory must not include secrets, but should include where the secrets are stored.\n    82\t\n    83\tNext, configure the Meta app named “KnearMe Meta Integration.” Enable Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and Marketing API (if ads will be used). Set the OAuth redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback`, configure the webhook callback at `<WORKER_URL>/webhook` with the chosen verify token, and subscribe to the fields used by the worker: comments, feed, mentions, and reactions. Add the Fix My Brick test accounts to the app’s roles or testers so they can authorize in development mode.\n    84\t\n    85\tThen, ensure that all Fix My Brick Pages and Instagram Business accounts are connected and that each test user is an admin of those assets. Confirm ad account access if ads endpoints are in scope, and capture the asset IDs in the inventory note.\n    86\t\n    87\tAfter the Meta app is configured, set Cloudflare secrets and variables for the worker. Confirm or update KV namespace bindings in `wrangler.toml`, set the dev `WORKER_URL`, and deploy the worker to the dev environment. This step makes the OAuth redirect and webhook endpoint live.\n    88\t\n    89\tFinally, perform the OAuth flow to cache tokens, validate the existing auth/comments/webhooks endpoints, and then run the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to add posts, analytics, and ads endpoints. After implementation, run the end-to-end validations described below.\n    90\t\n    91\t## Concrete Steps\n    92\t\n    93\tCreate a private inventory note outside git and record asset IDs and references to where secrets are stored. Use a location like `~/.knearme/meta-graph-worker-inventory.md` or another private location. The inventory should contain the app name, App ID, `WORKER_URL`, and the full list of Fix My Brick Page, IG Business, and ad account IDs. Do not store the App Secret or API keys in this file; instead, record where those secrets are stored (for example, in a password manager entry name).\n    94\t\n    95\tFrom `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`, ensure KV namespaces exist. If you need new ones, run:\n    96\t\n    97\t    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_CACHE\n    98\t    npx wrangler kv:namespace create META_EVENTS\n    99\t    npx wrangler kv:namespace create RATE_LIMITER\n   100\t\n   101\tEach command prints a new ID. If new IDs are created, update the bindings in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` to match. Re-run the command only if the namespace does not exist; if it already exists, skip creation and keep the existing IDs in `wrangler.toml`.\n   102\t\n   103\tSet secrets for the worker (run each command and paste the secret when prompted):\n   104\t\n   105\t    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_ID\n   106\t    npx wrangler secret put FB_APP_SECRET\n   107\t    npx wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN\n   108\t    npx wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY\n   109\t\n   110\tConfirm the dev `WORKER_URL` in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` matches the value you will use in the Meta app settings. If it changes, update it before deploying.\n   111\t\n   112\tDeploy the worker in dev mode from `/Users/aaronbaker/knearme-workspace/integrations/meta-graph-worker`:\n   113\t\n   114\t    npx wrangler deploy\n   115\t\n   116\tThe output should show a published worker URL that matches `WORKER_URL`.\n   117\t\n   118\tGenerate the OAuth URL by calling the worker and open it in a browser:\n   119\t\n   120\t    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n   121\t      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n   122\t      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   123\t      -d '{\"action\":\"oauth_connect\"}'\n   124\t\n   125\tExpect a JSON response containing an `auth_url`. Open that URL, authenticate as a Fix My Brick test user, and complete the consent screen. This will redirect to `<WORKER_URL>/oauth/callback` and cache tokens.\n   126\t\n   127\tVerify the connection by listing accounts:\n   128\t\n   129\t    curl -X POST <WORKER_URL> \\\n   130\t      -H \"Authorization: Bearer dev-token\" \\\n   131\t      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   132\t      -d '{\"action\":\"list_accounts\"}'\n   133\t\n   134\tExpect a response with pages and linked Instagram accounts. Compare the IDs to your inventory.\n   135\t\n   136\tValidate webhooks by simulating a verification request:\n   137\t\n   138\t    curl \"<WORKER_URL>/webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=<WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN>&hub.challenge=12345\"\n   139\t\n   140\tExpect the response body to be `12345`. A mismatch indicates the verify token is wrong.\n   141\t\n   142\tValidate comments endpoints using a real post ID from a Fix My Brick Page. Use the examples in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md`, and confirm successful responses.\n   143\t\n   144\tAfter completing the setup, run `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` to implement posts, analytics, and ads actions. Then validate each action with a real asset ID and record successful responses in your private inventory note.\n   145\t\n   146\t## Validation and Acceptance\n   147\t\n   148\tAcceptance for this setup plan is achieved when the inventory note exists and includes all Fix My Brick asset IDs, the Meta app is configured with the correct products and redirect/webhook URLs, and the worker is deployed with the correct secrets and `WORKER_URL`. The OAuth flow must succeed, `list_accounts` must return all expected Pages and Instagram accounts, and the webhook verification endpoint must echo the challenge for the configured verify token. After the implementation plan is executed, posts, analytics, and ads endpoints must return successful responses against real assets.\n   149\t\n   150\t## Idempotence and Recovery\n   151\t\n   152\tThe setup steps are safe to repeat. Re-running `wrangler secret put` overwrites the secret value, which is safe if you provide the same value or intentionally rotate it. If a KV namespace ID changes, update `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml` and redeploy. If OAuth fails, repeat `oauth_connect` and complete the browser flow again; the worker will overwrite cached tokens. If webhook verification fails, confirm the verify token in both Meta and Cloudflare secrets, then retry.\n   153\t\n   154\t## Artifacts and Notes\n   155\t\n   156\tKeep short evidence snippets in your private inventory note, such as the `list_accounts` response and the webhook verification echo. Example structure:\n   157\t\n   158\t    Meta App: KnearMe Meta Integration\n   159\t    App ID: 123456789012345\n   160\t    WORKER_URL (dev): https://meta-graph-worker.floral-breeze-0a38.workers.dev\n   161\t    Pages: Fix My Brick - City A (ID 111...), Fix My Brick - City B (ID 222...)\n   162\t    IG Business: @fixmybrick_citya (ID 333...), @fixmybrick_cityb (ID 444...)\n   163\t    Ad accounts: act_555..., act_666...\n   164\t    Secrets stored in: 1Password entry \"KnearMe Meta Integration\"\n   165\t    list_accounts result saved: 2026-01-05\n   166\t    webhook verify echo: 12345\n   167\t\n   168\t## Interfaces and Dependencies\n   169\t\n   170\tThe setup depends on the Cloudflare Worker defined by `src/worker.ts` and its configuration in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/wrangler.toml`. It assumes the existing auth and comments actions defined in `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/README.md` are working and that OAuth redirects use `WORKER_URL`. The setup also depends on the Meta app being configured with Facebook Login, Webhooks, Instagram Graph API, and (for ads) Marketing API, and on the Fix My Brick test accounts having asset access. Completion of the implementation plan at `integrations/meta-graph-worker/docs/EXECPLAN.md` is required for posts, analytics, and ads actions to be available.\n   171\t\n   172\tPlan revision notes: Initial version created to inventory and configure the Meta app, assets, and Cloudflare worker before completing missing endpoint implementations.\n"}}

Add actions for `get_ad_sets`, `create_ad_set`, `update_ad_set`, `pause_ad_set`, `resume_ad_set`, `delete_ad_set`, `get_ads`, `create_ad`, `update_ad`, `pause_ad`, `resume_ad`, `delete_ad`, `get_ad_creatives`, `create_ad_creative`, `delete_ad_creative`, `get_ad_images`, `upload_ad_image`, `upload_ad_video`, plus `delete_campaign` for campaigns. Use the Marketing API endpoints with `ad_account_id` and entity IDs, and use the stored long-lived user token (not page tokens). Ensure the access token being used has `ads_read` for reads and `ads_management` for writes, and return actionable errors if permissions are missing. If `ads_management` is not app-reviewed yet, gate write actions with a clear error. For ad creatives, support promoting an existing Page post via `object_story_id`, a link-based creative using an `image_hash` from `upload_ad_image`, and a video creative using a `video_id` from `upload_ad_video`. Extend `get_ad_sets` and `get_ads` to accept `filtering` so callers can pass advanced filters, and extend `get_ad_insights` to accept `level` and `filtering` parameters so callers can request ad set or ad-level insights.\n    96\t\n    97\tFifth, update `src/handlers/index.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/types/index.ts` so the expanded ads actions and new request parameters are wired end-to-end. Each action must return a `MetaResponse` with `success`, `data`, and a human-readable `message`.\n    98\t\n    99\tFinally, validate everything with real API calls using curl against the deployed worker and record the expected outputs. Add a short section in `docs/README.md` describing the new endpoints and required permissions.\n   100\t\n   101\t## Testing Strategy (TDD)\n   102\t\n   103\tUse Vitest for unit tests. For each handler:\n   104\t\n   105\t1. Write failing tests for parameter validation and request construction.\n   106\t2. Implement or adjust handler logic to pass.\n   107\t3. Add regression tests for caching and error handling.\n   108\t\n   109\tUnit tests should mock `fetch` plus token/cache helpers and live under\n   110\t`src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`.\n   111\t\n   112\t## API Reference Notes (Context7)\n   113\t\n   114\tMarketing API (ads):\n   115\t- List ad accounts for a user: `GET /<BUSINESS_SCOPED_USER_ID>/assigned_ad_accounts`\n   116\t  with `access_token`.\n   117\t- List campaigns: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with `fields=...` (include\n   118\t  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `objective` as baseline fields).\n   119\t- Create campaign: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/campaigns` with\n   120\t  `name`, `objective`, `status`, `special_ad_categories`, `access_token`.\n   121\t- List ad sets: `GET /act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets` with `fields=...` (include\n   122\t  `id`, `name`, `status`, `effective_status`, `campaign_id`, `daily_budget`,\n   123\t  `lifetime_budget`, `start_time`, `end_time`).\n   124\t- Create ad set: `POST /vXX.X/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adsets` with `name`,\n   125\t  `campaign_id`, `billing_event`, `optimization_goal`, `targeting`, and either\n   126\t  `daily_budget` or `lifetime_budget`.

For Instagram video and reel content, `get_ig_media_status` must return a status indicating processing completion before publishing, and `publish_ig_media` must return success with a media ID. For Facebook scheduling, a scheduled post must show a future `scheduled_publish_time` and appear in the Page’s scheduled posts list; if the API does not allow scheduled media uploads, the worker must return an explicit error explaining the limitation. Each action should return a `MetaResponse` with `success: true` and a clear message on success, and a human-readable error on missing parameters or permissions.\n   100\t\n   101\t## Idempotence and Recovery\n   102\t\n   103\tThese changes are additive and can be applied repeatedly without destructive effects. If an IG container is created but not yet published, re-run the status check until it is ready and then publish; if a publish call fails, re-run it with the same `creation_id`. If a multi-photo upload fails mid-way, re-run the request with the same photo URLs and let the handler upload fresh unpublished photos. If OAuth permissions are missing, re-run the OAuth flow after updating the scopes and retry the publish action.\n   104\t\n   105\t## Artifacts and Notes\n   106\t\n   107\tKeep short, redacted curl transcripts for each posting type in a private note. Example snippets:\n   108\t\n   109\t    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"id\":\"1234567890\"},\"message\":\"Post created successfully\"}\n   110\t    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"creation_id\":\"1790...\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media container created\"}\n   111\t    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"status_code\":\"FINISHED\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media status retrieved\"}\n   112\t    {\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"id\":\"1790...\"},\"message\":\"Instagram media published successfully\"}\n   113\t\n   114\t## Interfaces and Dependencies\n   115\t\n   116\tIn `integrations/meta-graph-worker/src/types/index.ts`, extend `MetaAction` and `MetaRequestParams` to include Instagram publishing actions and fields. Add a new `InstagramPostContent` interface similar to the following, and extend `PostContent` with `photo_urls` for Facebook multi-photo posts:\n   117\t\n   118\t    export interface InstagramPostContent {\n   119\t      media_type: 'IMAGE' | 'VIDEO' | 'CAROUSEL' | 'REELS' | 'STORIES';\n   120\t      image_url?: string;\n"}}
