Really think about the architecture here and what that looks like because if we want to continuously add tools to this, the agent itself may not be good enough to make the right tool calls at the same time because maybe the complexity. It would be better off to hand context off to its sub-agents who also have tools.\n\nSo we really need to give the agent the personality that can adapt to the user.

Tool registration in /api/chat\n      - Add composePortfolioLayout as a tool in src/app/api/chat/route.ts.\n      - Its execute should call a new agent (or orchestrator phase) that returns:\n          - blocks (DescriptionBlocks schema)\n          - optional imageOrder (IDs)\n          - rationale, missingContext, confidence\n      - Ensure composePortfolioLayout is not called automatically in the interviewer loop unless\n        explicitly invoked.\n  2. Tool scoping for interviewer\n      - Enforce “fast‑turn only” in the interviewer loop (e.g., activeTools / toolChoice in AI SDK).\n      - Fast‑turn tools: extractProjectData, requestClarification, promptForImages,\n        showPortfolioPreview, suggestQuickActions, updateField, regenerateSection, reorderImages,\n        validateForPublish.\n      - Deep‑context tools: generatePortfolioContent, checkPublishReady, composePortfolioLayout.\n  3. Wire layout output to the UI\n      - In src/components/chat/ChatWizard.tsx, handle the composePortfolioLayout tool result:\n          - If blocks returned → call updateDescriptionBlocks.\n          - If imageOrder returned → call reorderImages.\n          - Maintain current behavior: editor panel is the only edit surface.\n  4. Gemini 3 provider options\n      - For interviewer loop: set thinkingLevel to low/none.\n      - For layout and deep‑context agents: set thinkingLevel to medium/high.\n      - Do not use thinkingBudget (Gemini 3 uses thinkingLevel).\n  5. Update docs\n      - docs/09-agent/README.md: tool inventory already updated; only add wiring note if needed.\n      - docs/09-agent/implementation-plan.md: keep Phase 2/4 alignment; add a brief “wiring complete”\n        note after implementation.\n\n  Expected outputs\n\n  - Layout decisions are only produced via composePortfolioLayout.\n  - Interviewer cannot trigger layout decisions directly.\n  - Chat UI applies blocks + optional image order without user-facing confusion."}

Only\n    generatePortfolioContent gets that today, so user‑typed “Am I ready to publish?” will never trigger\n    checkPublishReady, and “Generate content” won’t work unless they hit the button. This is a\n    regression in intent handling. src/app/api/chat/route.ts:495\n  - Medium: composePortfolioLayout side‑effect applies even when blocks is empty or low‑confidence; this\n    produces a “No valid description blocks to save” error. Consider guarding on blocks.length > 0 or\n    confidence/missingContext before applying. src/components/chat/ChatWizard.tsx:1884\n  - Low: ComposePortfolioLayoutData is defined but not included in ArtifactPart, so typed tooling\n    doesn’t reflect the new tool. src/types/artifacts.ts:240\n\n  Open questions / assumptions\n\n  - Should deep tools be invoked only via explicit UI actions (buttons/quick actions), or should\n    free‑text intent also auto‑set toolChoice?\n  - Do you want checkPublishReady to be available as a fast‑turn tool, or keep it deep‑context with\n    explicit routing?\n\n  Instructions for dev agent (what to change next)\n\n  1. Add explicit routing for deep tools: when the user asks to generate/publish/layout (free‑text or\n     quick actions), pass toolChoice in sendMessage so the server exposes the tool.\n  2. Add composePortfolioLayout to the ArtifactPart union.\n  3. Guard layout application: only apply blocks when blocks.length > 0 and optionally when confidence\n     is above a floor or missingContext is small.\n\n  If you want a concrete implementation option, I suggest:\n\n  1. Simple intent detection in ChatWizard for “generate”, “publish ready”, “layout/blocks” to attach\n     toolChoice.\n  2. Quick actions for “Compose layout” and “Check publish readiness.”"}

Your goal is to optimize this codebase for LLM consumption by creating a structured documentation system. This system will serve as the \"long-term memory\" for future AI agents, allowing them to understand the project architecture, workflows, and decisions without needing to re-read every file in the codebase.\nObjective\nInitialize a documentation directory named .agent and populate it with a structured snapshot of the current codebase. You must analyze the project files, technology stack, and patterns, then generate high-density, low-noise documentation.\nInstructions\nStep 1: Analyze the Codebase\nScan the current directory to understand:\nThe Tech Stack (Languages, Frameworks, Libraries).\nThe Directory Structure.\nKey Components (Database, API, Frontend, Backend).\nExisting configuration files.\nStep 2: Create Directory Structure\nCreate a root folder named .agent (if it doesn't exist) with the following subdirectories:\n.agent/System: For architectural context.\n.agent/Tasks: For PRDs and implementation plans.\n.agent/SOP: For Standard Operating Procedures and \"lessons learned.\"\nStep 3: Generate Core Documentation Files\nCreate the following files with the specific content guidelines below:\nA. .agent/System/project_architecture.md\nGenerate a high-level overview including:\nTech Stack: List all core technologies.\nProject Structure: A conceptual map of key folders and what they contain.\nKey Patterns: How data flows (e.g., Next.js Server Actions, Redux, MVC).\nDatabase Schema: A summary of data models (if applicable).\nIntegrations: List of external APIs or services used.\nB. .agent/README.md (The Index)\nCreate a master index file. This is the first file an agent should read. It must contain:\nA brief 1-sentence description of the project.\nA table of contents linking to all other files in the .agent folder.\nA guide on when to read which file (e.g., \"Read System/project_architecture.md for context on backend logic\").\nC. .agent/SOP/documentation_standards.md\nCreate an initial SOP file describing how to maintain this documentation. It should state:\n\"Always update .agent/System files when changing architecture.\"\n\"Create a new SOP in this folder if a complex task requires a specific workflow.\"\n\"Log major mistakes and how to avoid them in .agent/SOP/mistakes_log.md.\"\nStep 4: Configure Agent Rules (CLAUDE.md)\nCreate or update the root CLAUDE.md file. Add a section titled # Documentation Rules containing:\nContext Loading: \"Before planning any implementation, always read .agent/README.md to get context.\"\nMaintenance: \"After implementing features, you must update the relevant docs in .agent to reflect changes.\"\nDocumentation Structure: Briefly list the .agent folder structure (System, Tasks, SOP).\nStep 5: Create Automation Command (commands/update-doc.md)\nCreate a file at commands/update-doc.md (create the commands folder if needed). This file will serve as a prompt for future updates.\nContent of commands/update-doc.md:\nYou are an expert code documentation expert. Your goal is to do a deep scan & analysis of the codebase to provide super accurate & up-to-date documentation.\nWhen asked to initialize or update documentation:\nPerform a deep scan of the codebase (frontend & backend) to grab full context.\nUpdate .agent/System/project_architecture.md to reflect the current project state (tech stack, structure, DB schema).\nIf there are critical/complex parts, create specific documentation in .agent/System.\nIf we just finished a feature, check .agent/Tasks and mark plans as complete or update findings.\nSOP Generation: If the recent work involved a complex process (e.g., database migration, API integration), generate a reusable SOP in .agent/SOP.\nUpdate .agent/README.md to include an index of all documentation files so we know where to look.\nExecution\nNow, proceed to execute these steps. Output the files and structure based on your analysis of this specific codebase."}
