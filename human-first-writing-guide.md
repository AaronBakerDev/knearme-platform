# Human-First Writing Guide (inverse of Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing")

## Content
- Kill puffery about symbolism/legacy: if a fact is ordinary, state it plainly; skip claims that something is "pivotal," "enduring," or "a testament" unless a source says so. citeturn0view0
- Avoid "notability proof" lists. Summarize what sources say; do not cite outlets merely to show coverage or copy guideline phrases like "independent coverage." citeturn1view1
- Delete bolt-on "-ing" analyses at sentence ends (highlighting/underscoring/showcasing). Facts and events do not "highlight" anything on their own—attribute interpretations or cut them. citeturn1view1
- Strip promotional adjectives ("captivating," "nestled," "stunning natural beauty") and travel-brochure tone. Keep neutral description. citeturn1view2
- Skip didactic disclaimers and meta "this article will explore..." openings; start with sourced information.
- Remove section wrap-ups and outline-like "challenges/future prospects" conclusions; let the narrative end when facts end. citeturn0view0
- For list articles, do not treat the list title as a proper noun (e.g., "The 'List of songs about Mexico' is..."); describe the scope instead. citeturn2view0

## Language & Grammar
- Drop overused AI vocab: align, crucial, delve, enhance, fostering, garnered, highlight, intricate, key, landscape, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, testament, underscore, vibrant—prefer concrete verbs and nouns. citeturn2view0
- Avoid negative parallelisms ("not only... but...", "not just... it's..."); write the main point once, directly. citeturn2view1
- Avoid rule-of-three padding ("adjective, adjective, adjective" or three parallel phrases); give the single fact that matters. citeturn2view2
- No vague weasel attributions ("some critics argue," "observers note"); name the source or omit. citeturn2view2
- Skip elegant variation that swaps synonyms to sound varied; pick the precise term and stick with it.
- Avoid false ranges ("from art to technology to social change") unless a real scale exists; otherwise list items plainly. citeturn2view3

## Style
- Use sentence case for headings unless a house style says otherwise; avoid reflexive Title Case. citeturn1view2
- Use bold sparingly (e.g., first bold of topic name in Wikipedia); do not bold whole sentences or list labels. citeturn3view1
- Write paragraphs, not inline-header vertical lists that mimic outlines. citeturn3view1
- No emojis in prose or headings. citeturn3view1
- Keep em dashes rare and purposeful; prefer commas, colons, or parentheses for asides. citeturn3view0
- Use straight quotes/apostrophes; avoid curly quotes unless required by the platform. citeturn3view1

## Voice & Interaction
- Remove collaborative chit-chat ("I hope this helps," "Would you like...?") and user-directed scaffolding; publish in neutral voice. citeturn3view1
- Do not add knowledge-cutoff caveats; instead date the source you cite. citeturn3view1
- Avoid prompt-refusal boilerplate ("as an AI language model..."); either provide sourced content or explain the sourcing gap neutrally.
- Delete templated phrasal frames ("in the heart of," "nestled in") and placeholder text before publishing. citeturn1view2

## Markup & Citations
- Write in the platform's native markup (e.g., wikitext, HTML); do not paste Markdown fences/backticks into wikitext. citeturn3view1
- Fix or remove broken external links; replace with archived versions or better sources. citeturn3view2
- Verify DOI and ISBN checksums before citing; remove hallucinated references. citeturn3view2
- Keep references where they are used; no orphaned named refs or non-existent templates/categories. citeturn3view1

## Checklist before publishing
- Specificity: concrete facts, dates, numbers, names; zero puffery.
- Attribution: every opinion tied to a named, cited source.
- Tone: neutral and concise; no promo adjectives or outline-like fillers.
- Language: no AI-vocab clusters, rule-of-three padding, or false ranges.
- Punctuation/formatting: minimal em dashes; straight quotes; sentence-case headings; no emojis/bold overuse.
- Markup/references: native markup only; working links; valid DOI/ISBN; no unused or placeholder refs/categories.
