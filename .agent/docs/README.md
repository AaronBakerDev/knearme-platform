# .agent/docs

This folder holds AI-agent focused documentation (Codex/Claude workflows,
ExecPlan guidance, prompts). It is not the canonical home for developer or user
knowledge about the product. For canonical docs, see
`../System/canonical_docs_index.md`.

## Policy

- Canonical developer and user documentation stays in `docs/`.
- `.agent/` contains AI-operational summaries and guidance only.
- Avoid duplicating long docs. Link to canonical sources instead.

## Contents

- `codex_exec_plans.md` - Codex ExecPlan guidance (reference)
